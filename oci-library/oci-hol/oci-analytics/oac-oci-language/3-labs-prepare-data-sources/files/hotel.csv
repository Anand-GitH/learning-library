575499706,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-04-24,Vancouver X Inn,"This XT property definitely meets my expectations for a full service hotel as facility is well maintained and the employees are extremely courteous and attentive.  The room was pleasant and for me was a two room suite.  The master bed had its own door for privacy and the bathroom is accessible by both rooms via a single door.  There was plenty of room to relax with a hide-away sofa and the desk was well lit for work.  A simple service bar is available with complimentary coffee/tea and a wine refrigerator.  The view I had was shared by the Executive lounge which overlooks the Crystal Mall.  If you're into sushi, there are two incredible places just across the street, as well as an Earl's and other fine dining.  It was close to where I needed to be so it was not only comfortable but convenient as well.  I have already returned to this property and hope to stay again when I return for more business."
477003835,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-04-18,Vancouver X Inn,"One night in Vancouver when we visited our son who goes to college there. I ravel a lot and stay in many hotels. The service at The Vancouver XT Metrotown was courteous and efficient. The 11th floor room was nicely appointed, spotlessly clean, and smelled fresh. The elevators actually go nice and quickly, which is a bonus on the 11th floor. Bed was comfy. Everyone was so friendly. Even the cleaning staff were full of smiles and wishing us a good morning.This makes a big difference! But best of all was the restaurant. We just had one meal there (dinner). The food was excellent (my wife has chicken and I had fish). The service was spectacular - our server was deligtfuland really on the ball (I forget her name, but she was from the Czech Republic Republic). She really looked after us. Overall an excellent stay and I highly recommend this hotel. It's a people business and these folk get it!"
488584133,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-05-28,Vancouver X Inn,"My vehicle was parked in underground hotel parkade during my 3 day stay there.  My vehicle was broken into shortly after I checked-in. The hotel asked if I was in valet parking - I was right beside it.  But no security cameras caught the break-in.  There was no electronic gate at the entrance or exit.  Very bad security!  I lost approximately $800 in valuables including prescription medication.  I asked if the hotel would pay the deductible for the broken window and locks.  I was told the XT did not own the parkade and that there were signs advising that it was not responsible for vehicle break-ins.  Other than that, I found the staff quite friendly and the accomodation quite nice.  The $30 I paid for my daughter's breakfast buffet was a little steep!"
242843543,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-12-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Vancouver was a significant stop on a 5 week road trip from Jackson, Wyoming, ending in Northern California.  To reduce expenses, I booked this hotel using XT points.  Although the hotel is not in downtown Vancouver, it was an easy train ride into town.  Our room was upgraded, and we had a separate bedroom and living area.  As a result, my friend had to sleep on a sleeper sofa which wasn't the most comfortable.  The extra space was helpful, but her sleeping arrangements weren't ideal.  The hotel staff is friendly and provided good directions to the train station and local transportation.  When driving it, it took us quite some time to find the hotel even with GPS, and traffic was horrific."
288729010,VCBCX1,Unknown,2015-07-13,Vancouver X Inn,"The best cost benefit for a family of four with an excellent location in Vancouver: public transportation, variety of good restaurants and a shoping mall at one block, plus an outstanding service from all employees of the hotel. My wife, two teen kids and I, comfortable in the same suite, it is possible at this unique XT. Despite some minor issues like: no microwave in the room, no breakfast family package, no shuttle to anywhere, which i would firmly suggest to XT of considering these easy improvements to gain the excellent, as the experience for staying for a long period is, so far, totally acceptable without suffering."
296762201,VCBCX1,Unknown,2015-08-07,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed 6 nights at this hotel a little bit further than Vancouver. It is a five minute walk away from the Metropolis Metrotown shopping mall and across the street from a supermarket and drugstore. The neighborhood is under construction but once inside the hotel you enjoy a quiet atmosphere and luxurious large rooms. Prefer to stay at a high level for enjoying the view to the buildings and mountains. We definitely recommand this hotel if you have a car to drive to Granville Island or Vancouver. Selfparking is available  for a fee but you can choose valet parking alternatively. We enjoyed free wifi.
168480110,VCBCX1,Unknown,2013-07-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Being a XT Diamond member for many years, to say I have many points of reference is redundant. This is one of those XT's which is a standout. the location is great; adjacent to Metrotown and SkyTrain. The executive lounge staff is top-notch and include Jennifer and Candace. The two ladies and very polite, professional, friendly and efficient. I could have easily stayed closer to my work, but found this XT my preference even if I had to take a taxi to and from work every day. I believe I stayed here at least 8 different weeks over a couple of years and will whenever I do visit again."
627361020,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-10-22,Vancouver X Inn,It was a first visit to Vancouver for a 3 day event held at this hotel. Every employee we encountered was intent on making sure our stay was comfortable and stress free.  The food was delicious both in the restaurant and at our event.  Our beds were comfortable and made up fresh every day. Especially appreciated were the manager and chef that came running to help with a nasty glue gun burn during prep for the event. That chef even checked on me during lunch the next day.  This hotel made an unforgettable event even better. Let's hope the Hearties use them again next year. â¤ï¸
422826413,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-09-27,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed three days pre cruise on route to Alaska and one day post cruise on return. The hotel is well positioned for the sky train for exploring down town with the usual comforts you expect from the XT brand. We were travelling with our two friends who like ourselves noted the friendly helpful manner of the staff. Sometimes in a big organisation this can be the hardest area to get right. But as we say in Scotland everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet and the staff from the doormen breakfast and bar staff to the reception were exceptional. Great chat and good fun.
558030698,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-02-02,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and had picked it due to its location near the skytrain. However despite being a XT Honors member and using 30,000 points we were given a different room to what we booked and it overlooked a noisy very large construction area. Very disappointing after a 14 hr plane trip! It was also near a very noisy ice machine - staff made no effort to discuss while we were there and to reconcile. Despite this beds were comfortable and food in restaurant in hotel was very good. The hotel lacks atmosphere though - needs a makeover. "
188227404,VCBCX1,Unknown,2013-12-21,Vancouver X Inn,"This was our first trip ti Vancouver (and Canada). This hotel is about a 20 minute train trip from the city center and water front but the train station is just a street or two away from the hotel, there is also a bus station nearby if you fancy a bus trip into town! There is a supermarket, a huge shopping center and lot of restaurants very close by too. To me, it seemed to be a area dominated by Asian shops and foods, which was wonderful! The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was great and kept spotless while we were there."
603130672,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-08-05,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent location, within walking distance from the Metro station, Metropolis mall, Pricesmart grocery store and Halal food whih is located right behind the hotel.The Filipino lady at the front desk (apologies I forgot her name) was very professional and kind. Mr.Raju at the conceirge was knowlegable and professional and helped us plan our activities.Ronaldo Santos the Bell man was helpful and extremely kind to my kids.The hotel room I stayed in was at the 14th floor, it was clean and nice. I would definitely stay there again."
632946445,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-11-12,Vancouver X Inn,"The entire staff was excellent and went beyond expectations. My companion became ill and they went out of their way to make her feel better. The manager went as far as going out to get pain medication for her and having a microwave brought to our room. With service like this, we will continue to come back each year. The location has access to a great balance of city vibe and neighborhood feel. There is so much you can walk to if you are interested in taking scenic excursions. I have no complaints whatsoever."
493689401,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-06-17,Vancouver X Inn,"It's 3.15am in the morning, I have two young babies and no CRIBS are available it's pure and utter torture we have had no sleep even though I called ahead before and requested them. Just told to sleep with them in bed which is impossible and unsafe with two of them. This is a night from hell. This is disgraceful and totally unfair. Hotel of bloody torture this is. Will never ever be staying here again. If you have children don't stay here your more than likely won't get a crib! Beware!!!"
427724843,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-10-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Vancouver has a lot of hotels - The XT Metrotown is a great hotel for business travelers.   It's a full service hotel and it has all of the amenities and services that you need.   Personally, I like it because of its location - I can easily drive to job sites - and if I want to go downtown, Translink station is close by.This is not the newest property but it's well maintained and nice and clean.   Staff are very friendly and helpful and speak multiple languages."
357298156,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-03-21,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here for just one weekend.  We never did use the internet, gym or pool. As we were too busy with friends and family.  But the view was nice, staff were great, room was very clean.  My husband and I would definitely stay there again. The location perfect; we could walk to shopping or restaurants, and use the sky train to get downtown. We do not like to drive much in Vancouver, so we left our car in the underground parking- which was extra, but worth it."
207977422,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-05-29,Vancouver X Inn,"The rooms are spacious, immaculate and the bed is luxurious.  The hotel was very quiet and the restaurant has an extensive buffet.   Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Burnaby.  Below the hotel is the delightful Crystal Mall which is an Asian Shopping Mall and across the street is a beautiful park.  Within a short block is the Metro Mall which is fantastic and offers all high brand name stores.  The location of this hotel cannot be matched!!"
542125603,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-11-19,Vancouver X Inn,This is the second year we have stayed at this hotel because of an event we attend. It is kind of an expensive hotel with expensive parking charges. We have never eaten in the hotel as there are a lot of less expensive alternatives for meals close by. If we did not get a group rate we would probably look for a less expensive alternative.  One thing to note - the beds seem kind of hard. By the third of the 6 nights we were there it was getting uncomfortable.
210704268,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-06-17,Vancouver X Inn,"why stay downtown when you can beat congestion by staying here? easy to reach all downtown activities n Richmond. located next to a mall with great Asian cuisine food court. disappointed in the small pool n spa size, though n the fact that its difficult to reach (definitely Not handicap accessible!).  but room was large, beds comfortable, view wonderful. parking is an extra $11.00/night charge, though.  really??? Why? breakfast buffet was great, but pricey."
460176110,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-02-15,Vancouver X Inn,"We would like to commend your staff Eddie. We booked 4 rooms next to each other on the 8th floor as we were all from out of town and went to Vancouver to attend a friend's funeral. On our last night, feb11,  we ordered soda to be brought to our room. When he learned we were having a get together to celebrate memories of our friend's life, he brought us plates, forks, chips and nuts! We were surprised and deeply touched with the gesture. Thank you Eddie!"
274211719,VCBCX1,Unknown,2015-05-24,Vancouver X Inn,"No need to pay exorbitant Vancouver downtown prices. This hotel worked out well for us. We got the King suite and was perfect for 2 adults and 2 kids. Hotel and rooms were very clean, staff friendly and helpful. Metrotown Skytrain station just 5 min walk away so very easy and reasonably priced to get to and from Vancouver downtown. Chinese food court of the adjacent Crystal Mall accessible from the 2nd floor with great Chinese and Malaysian options."
640437177,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-12-18,Vancouver X Inn,"I have stayed in this XT many times and it never disappoints, it is likely my favorite XT property.  There are a number of good restaurants within walking distance, although the food and service at the in house restaurant and bar normally keep me here.  If you want to head downtown the sky train is only a block away, it's about a 20 min ride.  For exercise, Central Park is a quick walk and offers a great trail and 5k path for a jog."
528619112,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-09-30,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is not in downtown, but it is very close to the sky train, that takes you to downtown in about half hour. It is also close to the Metrotown bus stand, where I got off when I came from Victoria by the ferry and then by bus. The metrotown mall is at the bus stand, 2 mins walking distance from the hotel, so there are lots of eating options here as well in the mallâ€™s food court. In that way, XT Metrotown is very well connected."
176000655,VCBCX1,Unknown,2013-09-05,Vancouver X Inn,"I've been travelling to the Metrotown XT for over 4 years, monthly, for business purposes and have had consistent, professional, kind and caring service from each and every staff, every visit. They know their jobs, always go the extra mile, are friendly, kind and sincere. They truly enjoy making every guests' stay comfortable and worry free. I know this because of how I am treated and how I see them treat other guests. Like family!"
397457911,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-07-25,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel has everything you need plus the nicest staff.  My key stopped working in the elevator and, the second time resetting it, the gentleman at the check-in counter came out to the elevator to try it himself.  He made sure I didn't have any problems.  As a woman often travelling alone, I felt very safe and comfortable.  Windows don't let a hint of outdoor sound in - totally quiet even with all the construction in the area."
497789391,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-07-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here using XT Honors points. The hotel is about 20 minutes outside of downtown Vancouver next to the enormous Metropolis Mall. The sky train is one block away and it will zip you into downtown. The hotel is comfortable, the room was clean and the service was really friendly and accommodating. The food is pricey, but in line for Vancouver (the 3rd most expensive city in the world). Had a nice five night stay."
333416739,VCBCX1,Unknown,2015-12-16,Vancouver X Inn,"I travel 40 weeks out of the year and have been a loyal XT guest for many, many years. Of all the XT brand hotels, this is my favorite. It has been two years or so since my last visit and it is still great. The staff, especially Jennifer in the Opal lounge are superb. Walking distance to Metrotown and Skytrain are added bonuses. Thank you for making my business trip relaxing and comfortable once again."
609668219,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-08-23,Vancouver X Inn,"Room was a King bed  delux on the 9th floor. Separate bedroom from living area. Clean, comfortable bed. Spent 3 nights on business - desk was well organized for laptop and plugs for charging to do work. Room was cleaned daily - friendly staff. Just sorry I missed the bbq on the rooftop thursday evenings. Hotel was a 5 minute walk to Metrotown tower I and II and the sky train. Definitely recommend"
169110677,VCBCX1,Unknown,2013-07-25,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff were always welcoming, helpful and happy.  The hotel is perfectly situated for shopping, getting downtown by SkyTrain and having a suite for less than paying downtown prices.  The hidden secret is that it is attached to Crystal Mall that has amazing and authentic Asian food for a very affordable price.  With a kids and adult pool, it made it very nice for everyone to get what they wanted."
393351174,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-07-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Prices were very high, for a &quot;days inn motel&quot; experience. Quite basic, somewhere to sleep essentially. The pool is  a &quot;lap pool&quot;; enough for two people and the hot tub that was &quot;warm&quot; probably fit around 3 people. Not even a complimentary breakfast, $21.00 for the buffet, how tragic. However very good location, close to mall, skytrain, and food. Would not come back."
632366990,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-11-10,Vancouver X Inn,"We found this hotel perfect for a weekend getaway. It's close to Metrotown shopping center and to the Crystal Mall. Crystal mall for those that dont know is Asian focused; it's a great for food,farmers market, and herbal medicines. So many restaurants to dine  near by the hotel. Valet parking reasonable. The hotel bar/lounge and dining were clean, comfortable and relaxing. We'll be back."
428828920,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-10-17,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is located in a great area, especially if you are using public transit. Not the best for visitors with a vehicle, especially large SUV/Trucks. Parking is difficult at best. The hotel has been around now for 10+ years and starting to look a bit dated, the interior needs refreshing. Lot's of amenities nearby with in walking distance since the shopping mall is next door."
590955849,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-06-26,Vancouver X Inn,Really a super location to avoid the downtown Vancouver madness while still maintaining proximity. Right on the SkyTrain line with the metrotown station only a block from the hotel makes it super easy to go downtown. Hotel is clean and modern. Pool is small but it has a hot tub as well. A decent small gym which has a massive well appointed good life fitness across the street.
234877435,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-10-17,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel is centrally located to the downtown area and the airport with great views of the Mountains.  The staff was all very nice and my room was very clean.  As a Diamond member you are granted access to the penthouse suite where you can eat and relax and view the city.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again the next time I am in Vancouver.
517856154,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-08-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent hotel great service, friendly, helpful staff throughout the hotel including Reflect Lounge. We stay here once every six months for three days. The staff always remember us and go out if there way to make us feel welcomed. The most accommodating staff! Very happy with this hotel!  Thank you Colin, Cecilia, Steve, Adam, Jose x 2, and Marlene. Holly and Sharon"
579049860,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-05-09,Vancouver X Inn,"I always stay with XT so it was a no brainer for me to book at this hotel. Service was excellent! I had a gorgeous view of the North Shore Mountains from my 12th floor room my room itself was nowhere near worth what I paid for it. The furniture was old, worn out and frayed. Everything except the linens, mattress and TVs very much need replacing and/or updating."
208635401,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-06-02,Vancouver X Inn,"the room is clean and big enough. Considering it is XT the price is also attractive. However I think it should be equipped with free parking and free internet which is not. Maybe it is my fault not to check the parking police in advance(I think it will be free parking as all the other hotels I stay in Canada), so I was surprise to pay for the parking fee."
638393123,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-12-09,Vancouver X Inn,"Had rate issues with hotel. Hotel would not honor reserved rates. Diamond desk was very uncooperative. It will be a pleaseure to stay somewhere elese. Property if good, but XT's rate practices are unacceptable. There are no advantages to being diamond member beyond what our corporate rate offers. XT does not appreciate value of Diamond members. "
498666431,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-07-04,Vancouver X Inn,"There aren't too many XT properties in Vancouver, considering its size, but I chose this one because of its location to downtown, price and the reviews that I saw on it.  I wasn't disappointed.  The rooms were very nice and clean.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely stay here again the next time that I am in Vancouver."
207777008,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-05-28,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at the XT recently and found this hotel really went above and beyond anything we have experienced in other top rated hotels.  The staff seem genuine and caring and were always so nice to deal with.  The restaurant staff were top notch, and the house keepers were cheerful and very good at their job. Overall a pleasant experience."
482932378,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-05-08,Vancouver X Inn,"I was very pleased with my recent stay at the XT Vancouver; a very comfortable room with high end toiletries, friendly and helpful staff, and a well-run moderately priced restaurant.  It is easily accessible to all tourist and business destinations via the metro.  I will definitely stay at this hotel again upon my next trip to Vancouver."
312543845,VCBCX1,Unknown,2015-09-21,Vancouver X Inn,"The service here was unobtrusive, but helpful and friendly when we asked for anything.While it was out of the centre of the city the cheap public transport was close and made getting around easy and convenient.  We didn't realize how close we were to Metrotown Mall when we booked so it was an added bonus.The I room fridge was an added"
174596769,VCBCX1,Unknown,2013-08-28,Vancouver X Inn,"The pool and hottub were broken and when they were fixed, did not work properly. The pool was warmer then the hottub and the staff was unhelpful. The breakfast only goes until 9. Not family friendly and highly do not recommend this hotel. Any hotel in Vancouver and Burnaby would be better then this, at best, 2 star hotel."
204398465,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-05-06,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed for work so we didn't spend much time in the rooms, but they were clean and large. The staff were very helpful and attentive. The gym facilities are sparse and uninspiring, but the amenities were there. The roof top pool was nice and quiet for the most part. Proximity to the skyrail, metrotown station was key."
207760940,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-05-28,Vancouver X Inn,"I didn't expect much as this is not in Vancouver and I paid around 130$ per night. As I started going around the area and took the sky train, I realized the location of the hotel was perfect. The bed was pretty comfortable and the room size was big enough also. If you need to be in this area, I do recommend this hotel."
224912279,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-08-27,Vancouver X Inn,"My husband had a business trip to Vancouver, so the kids and I tagged along. The hotel was at a very convenient location, especially if you want some good Chinese food. The second floor of the hotel connects to Crystal Mall--a collection of Asian stores and food stands. We had a good time walking around there."
161292001,VCBCX1,Unknown,2013-05-15,Vancouver X Inn,"I was impressed at the  quaility of the resort, faulous lines on the baeds, which were amazinglt comfortable. WE had fabulous service, cleanliness is fantastic, food in executive loungs  great, views great .Location  is amazing next to Metrotown,  the largest Mall in BC, and a bonus of chinese mall next door."
458791677,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-02-11,Vancouver X Inn,"Rooms are always clean and comfortable, they're probably due for an upgrade. They're quite large, which is also nice, I find newer hotels have ridiculously time rooms. Great location - right across from Metrotown! Shopping!! The best part about this hotel is the staff, they're incredibly friendly and helpful."
570882991,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-04-03,Vancouver X Inn,"We chose this hotel due to its location near Skytrain, Metrotown, and a park. It did not disappoint, and hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. They were in the midst of a few repairs and maintenance to the building which is understandable, and can only mean it will be better when you stay there.  "
177975723,VCBCX1,Unknown,2013-09-20,Vancouver X Inn,"When visiting Vancouver BC this is the perfect central location hotel to stay. Everyone is friendly and at your service to make the experience worth coming. We will come back. Helped us in places to go and see and the hotel is safe and very comfortable, great pool, friendly staff at the Bar and good food."
302247487,VCBCX1,Unknown,2015-08-22,Vancouver X Inn,I stay at the XT regularly for business trips and the staff are always friendly and helpful. Facilities in the hotel are great and there are lots of restaurants and other places around the area. I especially like the outdoor pool (even in winter) and the rooms on the corner with windows on two sides.
342467983,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-01-24,Vancouver X Inn,"Booked thru travelzoo because was a better deal than thru hotel itself ! Was told when booked thru hotel would be best deal and would honour any deals and match ! Well they didn't and so booked thru travelzoo at a great saving , hotel was fine  nothing special , strange room for 1 bedroom suite but ok "
170168678,VCBCX1,Unknown,2013-05-31,Vancouver X Inn,"I was very pleased with the service and cleanliness of this hotel.  There were staff available for great service, and they were very helpful.  I will return to this hotel when visiting Vancouver.  Being near the SkyTrain and Metrotown makes it a great location.  There is also a park across the street."
567574127,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-03-19,Vancouver X Inn,Me and my girlfriend stayed here for one night and she did not want to leave the staff were amazing and the room was excellent I would definitely stay in this hotel next time I travel. Only issue I found was the tub was very slippery felt very unsafe taking a shower would recommend rubber foot pads
236355770,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-10-26,Vancouver X Inn,Always enjoy staying here. Great service. Use the valet parking- worth the extra cost. Room was near the elevator so was quite noisy. Pillows way too soft so with the noise didn't sleep really well. Great banquet with our event. This is a good horel. Would have been 5 stars if it hadn't been noisy.
252187876,VCBCX1,Unknown,2015-02-01,Vancouver X Inn,"pool hot tub fitness center VERY small and disappointing. paid for executive rate and executive lounge was closed upon arrival, found out later staff had failed to give me coupon for appy's in hotel lounge. Requested to get regular rate and opt out of executive rate and was refused by manager."
473708167,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-04-08,Vancouver X Inn,The main issue is that this hotel doesn't have its own designated parking lot so you must struggle getting through a parking lot shared by the mall.  So if your not in a car the hotel is fine. Nice views etc... but if you have a car be prepared to be frustrated on weekends and afternoons. 
245200654,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-12-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent hotel with very friendly staff. The check in process was very fast and convienent The rooms were clean, the lobby inviting and breakfast was great. The beds made for a very comfortable stay. Highly recommend this hotel to others to stay at. I will be staying at this hotel again."
402667991,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-08-07,Vancouver X Inn,"excellent family stay. subway near hotel is great bonus- 25 min to downtown. We took CAA package and enjoyed very good breakfast included to the price. We recommend to use e-check in, we had option to choose our room and floor using hotel's room map.  highly recommenced for any occasion."
414735816,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-09-04,Vancouver X Inn,We booked a room for 2 nights. One of those nights was not available. The staff upgraded us for free. Top floor beautiful view even tho there was lots of construction. Super friendly staff. The pool and hot tub need some major upgrading. Love how close metro shopping was. Great stay! 
188637757,VCBCX1,Unknown,2013-12-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Believe me when I attest that each and every staff member you will encounter here are not only efficient and professional, but warm, friendly, kind and caring. They are genuine folks who always go out of their way to treat me and every guest like gold! They are wonderful people!!!"
234325884,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-10-14,Vancouver X Inn,"I've been in this hotel from OCT 9th to 13th for an AIESEC regional conference. It was simply amazing, great servicing, nice rooms, very friendly and kind staff and the food was good. I would recommend it for both Tourism and Business, you will not regret what you paying for."
561596873,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-02-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Superb place, spotless, comfortable, tremendous staff, and convenience you can't beat. You are in the heart of Burnaby, most everything is in walking distance, including the SkyTrain, which puts you in the heart of Vancouver in 15 minutes. Value for your money can't be beat."
497148889,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-06-29,Vancouver X Inn,We were in XT for five days ! Very centrally located ! Just next to metropolis mall and sky train !

545888501,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-12-07,Vancouver X Inn,The XT at Metro town is an exceptional hotel with the greatest staff.  A true home away from home! The staff treat you like a friend and go out of their way to attend to your needs while there. I would highly recommend the XT at Metro town to anyone going to Burnaby.
194767470,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-02-20,Vancouver X Inn,I just love staying here! Best beds! And the best front desk service! We arrived early for meetings and were allowed early check in and also a later check out! They really accommodate me and I like that the front desk people always are smiling! It makes a big difference!

332467005,VCBCX1,Unknown,2015-12-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Our room on the 12th floor was very clean, bed was comfortable and loved the pillows. Would definitely recommend to others.

471791776,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-03-31,Vancouver X Inn,"What a find! Close to great shopping, the sky train, and fast access to the highway - very central if you have to get around the lower mainland.

Location is excellent and even though there is a lot of construction around the area, very little noise. The Skytrain was out of commission for a few hours but taxis are plentiful."
512913430,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-08-14,Vancouver X Inn,It is not value at all which u pay for per night. Even online pre checkin is not useful when you arrived we got room at 4.30 inspite of 3 o clock time. No option for vegetarians except bread and fruits and Chefs doesn't know how to cook and they will not do as well
357861932,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-03-23,Vancouver X Inn,The room was small nothing special. Hot tub was a 4 person packed while children running wild dive bombing and unsupervised in the lengths pool.  For a XT i day they could do better at this one. Considering parking id $16.00 and internets $6.95 for 3 devices. 
202469323,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-04-23,Vancouver X Inn,"From fire alarms going off all night long,to worn decor and uncaring (bordering on rude) staff, this hotel has relied on its location for too long. The convenient location no longer makes up for its glaring deficits. It's off my list for handy aces to stay."
389743853,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-07-06,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel including the elevator smells of Chinese food. The smell is in some of the linens too. Our room was not cleaned properly. Found some person items (unmentionables) left by previous guests.XT should offer unbiased service to all guests.
253632497,VCBCX1,Unknown,2015-02-10,Vancouver X Inn,Very nice clean comfortable room.  The location is great and the staff is very friendly and accommodating! I would recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay in Burnaby.  Its a bonus that it is attached to metro town as well and near sky train!
601314296,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-07-30,Vancouver X Inn,"This location was convenient to restaurants, shopping and the SkyTrain for trips to downtown. The staff provided excellent reccomedations for attractions and restaurants. The roooms were very clean and modern. I would stay at this location again"
494420859,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-06-19,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff here were so nice and professional, yet personal. They gave us suggestions of things to do, places to visit and the best and safest ways to get there. Room was very nice, clean and quiet. Restaurant food and receptions were very nice."

571920419,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-04-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Our toilet was broken, our heating was broken and the people who tried to fix the problems were super invasive. The beds were not very soft. I was not happy with our stay considering we thought The XT to be a night we treat ourselves. "
445430531,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-12-19,Vancouver X Inn,The gem is located across the street from metro town which made it easy for Xmas shopping. The room was very clean and bright. The buffet breakfast was $22.00 which I found very expensive especially when most of the food trays were empty. 
507494027,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-07-31,Vancouver X Inn,right in the heart of Metrotown. Comfy bed. You can hop a train to downtown easily. great if you dont want to spend $500 a night + for downtown hotel.  lots of local asian choices for food near by. also Earls was a great meal we had.
217138570,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-07-23,Vancouver X Inn,"Badly on need of an update. Uncaring rude staff, great location. Overpriced and living on its reputation. Unless they make some improvements they will find their customer base dwindles.bathrooms are clean but worn. View is great."

227836213,VCBCX1,Unknown,2014-09-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Close to all trains, buses and a very large shopping center. The staff are very good and the rooms are quiet and clean. Only $40 taxi from the airport. The bar and restaurant staff look after you very well. I will be back."

465640615,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-03-08,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is always a pleasure. Check in fast and easy. Friendly staff.   The odd time the room has minor issues, more things I am sure have never been reported to maintenance. Reasonable close to the shopping center."
606875294,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-08-15,Vancouver X Inn,Receptionist are not paying attention and everything went wrong! I called i email i never got any response. Do try to find a better place to stay if you have a plan to visit vancouverDo not stay in this property
464818172,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-03-05,Vancouver X Inn,I'm a local but have been at many conventions here and have stayed on other occasions. Service is first class and staff have a can do attitude- highly recommended for large groups or just on your own or couples
576531930,VCBCX1,Unknown,2018-04-29,Vancouver X Inn,"right next door to Metrotown mall - very hardworking staff who make you feel welcome. good cappuccino! reasonable breakfast. good quality fish on menu. fast, reliable internet. only 30 minutes from the airport"
161292423,VCBCX1,Unknown,2013-05-15,Vancouver X Inn,"extremely substandard beds and pillows, super  stinky lobby no free wi fi expensive for everything at hotel........................... I would never stay here again the location was very close to the mall"
354482480,VCBCX1,Unknown,2016-03-10,Vancouver X Inn,Very nice overall but not the greatest location.  We would recommend to others that need to be in that general area but would probably not stay here again unless we needed to be in that particular place.
532894759,VCBCX1,Unknown,2017-10-14,Vancouver X Inn,XT Diamond Member here. To travellers reading this: the only reason why I would write that in the first line is because these reviews wouldn&#39;t be read by the hotel otherwise.
358768008,VCBCX1,ABBOTSFORD B.C. CANADA,2016-03-26,Vancouver X Inn,"This location is great for shopping and is only a few minute walk from the sky train station. The staff are friendly and the rooms are clean. The hotel is set up weird and it hard to find the small outdoor pool. There is a great Asian style mall/food court attached to the hotel and all though this is convenient, it also brings the smell into the whole hotel.  Better prices that downtown Vancouver and a 15-20 min sky train ride that cost about $3 will get you into the heart of downtown. "
181438500,VCBCX1,"Abbotsford, Canada",2013-10-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Hotel was good and a hop away from shopping the Metro mall but room service is not 24 hrs. When I am out and about it would be nice to have a list of pizza or pasta places that deliver to the hotel especially if I drove by one on the way down. I guess I shouldn't assume that the hotel would know better than what I have saw. Next time I'll do more research as who offers those midnight snack. Could of been worse I'm sure I saved a few midnight calories, lol."
184982516,VCBCX1,"Adelaide, Australia",2013-11-17,Vancouver X Inn,Just completed 3 night stay.  Great accommodation very close to Skytrain and the access to downtown that it provides.  Great service in the Restaurant and Bar.  Special mention to Jonathan made the last night very entertaining.  Retail mall just across the street make it a great location.
447982843,VCBCX1,"Aiea, Hawaii",2016-12-30,Vancouver X Inn,"Although it was only for one night, our stay was a pleasant one. Wish I stayed longer as I heard there was a casino just minutes away and a huge mall which we did go to. Plus there was a Chinese shopping mall next door. Walked through it and wish I walked around more but time was limited."
347043822,VCBCX1,"Airdrie, Alberta, Canada",2016-02-11,Vancouver X Inn,Very close to skytrain Doesn't include a bottle of water Bathroom doors open outwards like a closet Higher up is better to not hear the skytrain Use the XTHonors phone app (makes it easier) Internet is only 1MB throughput unless you pay for premium Shopping mall is very close by (for anything forgotten at home) Starbucks is 1 block away.
345710266,VCBCX1,"Airdrie, Canada",2016-02-07,Vancouver X Inn,I have stayed at the XT Vancouver Metrotown several times over the past 10 years for both business and pleasure.    My wife and I stayed again this past weekend and it was just as good as always.   I've stayed in hotels in many spots around the world and have found no better staff than at the XT Vancouver Metrotown.  Everyone is friendly and very attentive.  They make eye contact and make you feel welcome.  We had a one bedroom suite that was excellent.  The breakfast buffet was excellent and reasonably priced.  This is a great hotel on all fronts.
275662764,VCBCX1,"Airdrie, Canada",2015-05-29,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel is a great choice for anyone wanting easy access to downtown Vancouver but without downtown prices.  It's a easy drive or cab in to downtown Vancouver or Skytrain transit is a block away.   The hotel was clean and quiet --it's also across the street from Metrotown Shopping Mall (including grocery stores) for ease of picking up anything you might need while travelling.
251695863,VCBCX1,"Aix-les-Bains, France",2015-01-29,Vancouver X Inn,"The room is clean, quite large and the personnel is always at your disposal, particularly at reception area. The restaurant is not a great quality, the service is long and not at level of the brand, the dishes that I tried was not particular taste nor really inviting while the wine was nice. If you wish to eat better than go downtown it is to be preferred."
459902565,VCBCX1,"ajax, Canada",2017-02-14,Vancouver X Inn,"Very happy with staff and overall quality of the stay.  Very clean and great location for travelling through out the city.  Shuttle service and ( Joe) makes it easy for travellers who are unfamiliar with the area.   The lounge is a great place to relax after a work day or a great place for a social gathering.  Would definitely recommend this  hotel to family, singles and all business travellers.   The Sky train and Metro Mall are all   within walking distance so there is always something to do."
185262538,VCBCX1,"Ajax, Canada",2013-11-19,Vancouver X Inn,My favourite place to stay when in town on business. The staff treats you like a valued customer.  Service is excellent and rooms are beautiful. Parking garage is a bit dicey but not enough of an issue to make me stay somewhere else! Great breakfast buffet and the bar is a nice place to chill with a drink after work.
349028967,VCBCX1,Alberta,2016-02-18,Vancouver X Inn,"Good, standard XT. Nice location to Metrotown and Skytrain, super easy to zip into downtown Vancouver. Self-park underground was reasonable at $21 but the $50 per night pet fee I thought was completely ridiculous. Bland lounge, bland food but there are tons of dining options within a block or two. Again, without the pet fee you can't beat the location for a shopping trip."
304726510,VCBCX1,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",2015-08-29,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here one night just passing through.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was great, which included menu items or a buffet.  Buffet was well stocked, hot and cold, fresh fruit and pastries.  You could eat outside on the balcony or in the main room.  Location was nice to walk to little shops or to have a drink."
222805777,VCBCX1,"Aldergrove, Canada",2014-08-18,Vancouver X Inn,It is a relatively new facility. The room was well appointed and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. We arrived late and left early so we were not able to experience any the amenities. I would stay in this facility again.
585660223,VCBCX1,"Allen, Texas",2018-06-06,Vancouver X Inn,"I would not recommend this hotel for a pleasure trip. Staff was not very friendly and the hotel caters to business trips. The restaurant on site was good but very expensive. Construction and bad city views of Vancouver. There wasnâ€™t much to do close by and not many restaurants. Fortunately for us, this was just a stay over until our flights the next morning. Not a good hotel."
629273168,VCBCX1,"Alstonville, Australia",2018-10-28,Vancouver X Inn,I stayed at this hotel for an event that was hosted there. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Complimentary WiFi was amazing. Very close to major shopping centre and train station. I was with a small group and we did a tour of the Rockies following our stay here and XT stored our excess luggage for a week following checkout without any problems. The collection process was so easy and the valets were very helpful in packing our car up again for us! 
590742986,VCBCX1,"Amherstburg, Canada",2018-06-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Rooms were clean, the food was great and the staff was awesome !! The location was close to some very good restaurants and the Metroline was within walking distance. The mall was close to the hotel and it was just a good stay. "
164417717,VCBCX1,amsterdam,2013-06-18,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed here for one night at the tail end of a long business trip.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  I got an upgrade to a suite which was in good condition and I liked the decor - light and airy.  The executive lounge was the best out of the one's I stayed at on this work run though it still doesn't even come close to comparing to the XT in Bangkok.  They have a nice balcony area with a single lane lap pool which was great for a cool morning swim as it was heated.  The gym is pretty dark and small.  Is it the best XT, no.  Is it the worst, far from it though the price seems steep (though all hotels in Canada seem expensive for what they are)."
586921106,VCBCX1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",2018-06-12,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel isn't bad, nice location. Staff is nice but the rooms feel like they're missing something. It's the same story with the breakfast buffet and the pool, almost made it but just missed. They charge gold members for hot breakfast and the pool is a joke, I don't even know why they built it. Parking is $16 a day in a somewhat confusing garage. On the plus side the lounge is a nice place to relax, have a drink and watch the game. Will probably stay again because the number of XT properties within the area and affordability is limited."
322008857,VCBCX1,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",2015-10-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Fine hotel, bit of a way into the city, but easy 20 min drive and public transport available just outside the door.Received upgrade to a suite as HHonors member, and also access to Executive Lounge. Lounge is nothing special but access appreciated. Evening snacks, 2 warm and also salad items and filled rolls. Free soft drinks and Honor bar for alcohol. Staff attentive."
284535449,VCBCX1,"Anacortes, Washington",2015-06-30,Vancouver X Inn,"Charming staff, comfortable rooms. Very clean, modern, and cozy. The location by the park and close to the Skytrain makes this place a &quot;must stay&quot;. We met friends there and everyone agree this was a great value."
374722944,VCBCX1,"Anaheim, California, United States",2016-05-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Enjoyed our stay! Exit cruise ship Coral Princess, we ventured off from Downtown Waterfront, Vancouver, walked with our bags to board the SkyTrain where we met family members from Seattle, WA to Metrotown XT which for us was within walking distance from SkyTrain."
505995315,VCBCX1,Ancaster,2017-07-26,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel offered modern rooms that were spacious, clean and comfortable for our family of 4. Staff was the best part. They were friendly and helpful often going above and beyond the level of service you would expect. Continental Breakfast was included and for a very small amount, you could upgrade to an awesome hot breakfast. Lots to choose from and full service dining room. Highly recommend this hotel. "
546709746,VCBCX1,"Anchorage, Alaska",2017-12-11,Vancouver X Inn,If your looking for a room to just stay at and do your own thing out and not spend your whole time in the room this would be it. Although I think they charge way too much for a motel size room and the quality is not something I would see in a XT property Iâ€™ve seen and stayed at many XTâ€™s and not once have I seen it this crappy!
371725306,VCBCX1,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",2016-05-10,Vancouver X Inn,Loved our stay here.  The hotel is beautiful.  We had a one bedroom suite on the 15th floor and the views were incredible.  The bed was extremely comfortable-loved the feel of the bedding.  Definitely plan to stay here next time I'm in Vancouver!
492355624,VCBCX1,ANNAPOLIS,2017-06-11,Vancouver X Inn,"My reservation was for an upper floor King Suite. I was placed on the 11th floor of the 18 floor hotel and advised that all upper floor rooms were taken. After gathering the luggage cart and my luggage in front of the bellman, he followed me to the elevator and then asked if I needed assistance???  I arrived in my room to find the soiled bathroom. I called the front desk and informed them of the bathroom condition and requested to be relocated. I returned to the front desk and spoke with the manager who acknowledged the room's condition and offered me a choice of a room on the 16th or 18th floor. I was obviously struck by the new found upper floor room availability??? Bottom line, the weekday staff was considerably more professional and supportive and this hotel is in desperate need of maintenance, upgrades, replacement of furnishings, and staff training."
178555773,VCBCX1,"Annapolis, Maryland",2013-09-25,Vancouver X Inn,"A last minute trip to Vancouver left us with only a few reasonably priced business hotels.  This XT is clean, safe, affordable with a charming staff.  There is a huge mall across the street with many shops and a few decent restaurants.  But...there are no really good places to eat in the hotel or anywhere within walking distance.  You are in the suburbs for sure at this hotel.  So, if you want a decent place to meet for dinner you will need to take the 20 minute drive into downtown Vancouver.  If your work is on the east side of Vancouver or in Burnaby then it is hard to beat the convenience of this property.  All in...not too bad."
167595486,VCBCX1,"Annapolis, Maryland",2013-07-14,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent hotel. Good location on outskirts of Vancouver. Good access to downtown Vancouver and nearby sites. Friendly, competent professional staff. Enjoyed our stay immensely. Would return in the future for business or pleasure."
274303441,VCBCX1,"Apex, North Carolina",2015-05-24,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at this hotel last week, as I went to an event at the Vancouver Convention Center. First, this hotel is in Burbany, 30 minutes from my event by car. There is plenty of option to get to Vancouver, including a convenient train.The hotel is in the middle of a Chinatown, with lots of signs and stores in Chinese.The room itself is good, like you would expect of a XT hotel.Overall, good experience"
218329753,VCBCX1,"Apple Valley, California",2014-07-29,Vancouver X Inn,"My husband and I had never travelled to Vancouver and did not completely understand how far away this hotel would be from Downtown Vancouver.  This hotel is old and needs some updating but our room was decent and clean. The staff members were very helpful and friendly.  They explained how we could get around Vancouver using the city transit system. What a fun experience - we went on the metro rail system, the sea bus and city bus. The hotel is located within a few blocks of the second largest mall in Canada and it was huge. Overall we had a good experience."
404256424,VCBCX1,"Artesia, California",2016-08-11,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel is actually in the city of Burnaby which is east of Vancouver.  The area itself is nice enough and all the buildings seem modern.  It's close to a couple of parks including Central Park. Metrotown Mall and the train station is about a 5 to 7 min. walk.  There are some restaurants in the area that are walking distance.  The hotel is right next to Crystal Mall and there's an Asian food court that's connected to the lobby via the 2nd floor.  The train ride to downtown Vancouver is about 20 min. The service from my experience was good.  The room was clean and spacious.  I would stay here again.
312881825,VCBCX1,ashby de la zouch,2015-09-22,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is convenient for the sky train (about 5 minutes walk) but if you are doing all the tourist stuff then down by the waterfront or Vancouver centre are to be recommended. we had breakfast one morning and it was very poor but not cheap so unless you get a deal with breakfast, go elsewhere.The bar service for food and drink was ok but can be very cold so dress up, but there are a few decent restaurants nearby which are quite worth a visit.The gym is old and needs a refurbishment (concept 2 rower must be 20 years old, model b, and is very tired) and more in keeping of third world hotels. I didn't try the outdoor pool."
303017359,VCBCX1,"Asheville, North Carolina",2015-08-24,Vancouver X Inn,"We chose the XT Metrotown in part because of the somewhat lower prices than similar properties in the main downtown areas of Vancouver. It's in the suburb of Burnaby, around 20 to 30 minutes from downtown depending on traffic and where you're going.Overall we liked the property. We had a car (parking is $11 Cdn self-park or $15 valet), but it isn't far from the SkyTrain that will take you to downtown Vancouver. The hotel is at Metrotown, a large mall and entertainment center, if you're into shopping. You should know, however, that there construction going on directly across from the hotel. A Best Buy and some other big store have just broken ground, so this could be a minor convenience over the next few months.For Gold and Diamond XT Honors members, there's an included continental breakfast and free wi-fi."
566332133,VCBCX1,"Assendelft, The Netherlands",2018-03-13,Vancouver X Inn,Hotel was close to metro to easily reach downtown and next to a large shopping mall. Hotel was well appointed with a parking garage underneath and good breakfast to kick start the day. Room was spacious and well equipped. would return when back in Vancouver!
482192279,VCBCX1,"Atlanta, GA",2017-05-06,Vancouver X Inn,This property is not new. It is at least 20 years old I would guesstimate. The layout and floorplan are clearly dated though there has been some effort made to maintain the property and ensure that the furnishings carpets etc. were in good condition.  The service was very average. The staff were superficially friendly and I had no major issues during my stay. The property could desperately do with some updating however the location around it makes up for some of this.  Next time I visit Vancouver I will definitely not return here  as there are several newer properties in that same neighborhood.
374989595,VCBCX1,"Atlanta, Georgia",2016-05-20,Vancouver X Inn,"After reading the review about foulSmells and viral outbreak, I was very hesitant to stay here. But I'm very glad we did. The hotel was clean, efficient and friendly. We were on the executive floor and had access to the opal lounge - free soft drinks and snacks, breakfast and appetizers - which we used for a light dinner. The attendant was excellent and the food was good. Our room had a lovely view and we were in walking distance of a large mall - a fun spot for after dinner walking. A great place to stay in Vancouver !"
585324737,VCBCX1,"Atlanta, Georgia",2018-06-05,Vancouver X Inn,"great location: close to the metro (sky train) for easy access to downtown or any corner of the city...  the service is really good, specially the room attendants who go the extra mile to leave you room spotless and even organize the kids toys in a way we all got a smile when arriving back in the room.  The restaurants around the hotel are very good, and the hotel restaurant is really good for breakfast... getting the menu is sometimes better than getting the buffet.  best bang for your buck!!"
530015409,VCBCX1,"Atlanta, Georgia",2017-10-04,Vancouver X Inn,"It is a quick, 5 min walk from the hotel to the Skytrain Metrotown station, and from there it is a 15 minute train ride to downtown.Hotel is nice, with a peek at the mountains but the view is becoming obscured by the many hi-rise buildings being built around it.  Many dining options nearby.We never made it to the rooftop pool - which we now really regret!Overall, a good hotel choice for those like us who wanted a nice hotel but who couldn't justify the very high downtown rates."
177380855,VCBCX1,"Atlanta, Georgia",2013-09-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Ideally, we would have stayed downtown, but this was a great value.  Glad we did, the sky train is next to the hotel and the drive into downtown Vancouver is not bad when traffic is moving.  The hotel is in good shape, our room was a little small, but clean and well-appointed.  Lot of places to eat close by, you can walk to a lot of places nearby if you wish.  If you can't stay downtown Vancouver due to high rates, this is a good alternative."
642060144,VCBCX1,"Atlanta, Georgia",2018-12-28,Vancouver X Inn,"Wouldnâ€™t have been my top choice in Vancouver, but hotels are expensive and this one was reasonably priced. The parking deck is tight and expensive, but we made it work. The beds were comfy and the bathrooms were clean. We had breakfast included and the spread was pretty good. Overall, a good hotel, but I wish it was in a better location."
501174425,VCBCX1,"Atlanta, Georgia",2017-07-12,Vancouver X Inn,What a beautiful city went to Stanley ParkAte at Earls great vegan meal and great wineThe pool at the hotel was a great work out even went on the open deck and workedWalking distance to the largest mallGrocery shopping got some local food while I was staying in town
314923874,VCBCX1,"Aurora, Illinois",2015-09-29,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a first class facility - modern, clean, outstanding service.  Close to public transportation which can get you anywhere in Vancouver very easily.  The service from the front door through every part of the hotel was just outstanding.  Just a note....the area around the hotel is a little seedy in some areas - adult book stores, tattoo parlors, but that does not take away from the service in the hotel."
288299714,VCBCX1,"Austin, Texas",2015-07-12,Vancouver X Inn,"I traveled to beautiful Vancouver last week on business and stayed at the XT Metrotown. It was a nice hotel, located central to many sites, although not downtown. The sky train is a 2 block walk from the hotel, and a 20 min ride from the downtown attractions. The hotel is attached to the Crystal Mall (an Asian shopping mall with every type of Asian cuisine or item you can ask for) and can be accessed from an escalator in the XT lobby. Free parking for hotel guests under the XT is shared with mall dwellers, but hotel guests park in blue areas. Walking distances to other restaurant choices. Nice hotel, I will be back when I return to Vancouver."
490790810,VCBCX1,"Austin, Texas",2017-06-05,Vancouver X Inn,Staying here was a wonderful experience! The staff was extremely helpful to me as I was traveling internationally.  Great location near many good restaurants and close to the Aquabus stop for a quick ride to Granville Island. Wonderfully comfortable rooms.I would stay here again and again!
552567224,VCBCX1,ayr,2018-01-08,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel was great for our stay. Lovely staff always happy to help and very pleasant. We stayed over the New Year and although there was a huge celebration we were not disturbed and the staff stayed professional and polite.  Very good experience with this hotel. 
292059725,VCBCX1,"Ballina, Australia",2015-07-24,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here pre cruise and highly recommend the place.The hotel is impressive in all a aspects with very comfortable beds, large rooms, quiet and the service is outstanding. We had a 100% strike rate with all staff members, very friendly, welcoming and go the extra yard to help, nothing was a problem.The train is close to take you to the cruise terminal.There is a mall closeby and food outlets next door.Next time we are in Vancouver we wouldn't hesitate staying again. "
638563462,VCBCX1,"Bangalore District, India",2018-12-10,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is very well located and so central to everything. I stayed here and shopped right across the street at the Metropolis Mall.Take a long weekender rate, its their best option. Lots of options available to eat on Kingsway."
580000078,VCBCX1,Bangor Maine,2018-05-13,Vancouver X Inn,"A great location.  7 stops to Chinatown which is all that matters to me while in Vanc, but why go to Chinatown when Burnaby is AMAZING for Chinese cuisine, markets, and yum. The hotel is great... quiet, very clean, well managed, and generous with square feet mimicking glass walled Vancouver. Breakfast on the third floor, workout on the second, or lumber along two blocks to the Metrotown stop.  A bit sterile, the entranceway doesnâ€™t portend well the rooms homey comfort and design.  I do wish they gave fruit and or coffee/ tea choices for guests near the concierge.  A great bonus is the building is built next to a great market with everything soups to nuts, and prepared foods.  Hang out.  People watch.  Learn to make a dumpling... worthy of the people of Vancouver.  "
213132272,VCBCX1,"Barcelona, Spain",2014-07-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Overall the hotel isn't too bad.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are immaculately clean.  The real downside was the food, which in a word was terrible.  Granted we had buffet food several times, but even by buffet standards it was less than adequate."
461551833,VCBCX1,"Barrie, Canada",2017-02-20,Vancouver X Inn,Metrotown service was good. The staff were very courteous and helpful. If you needed anything they were there to see what they could do to help. The cleaning staff were very polite . Most of all front of the house were excellent 
626138513,VCBCX1,BC,2018-10-18,Vancouver X Inn,"On check in, the person checking us in was very friendly and very helpful. He took the time to upgrade us on our stay where he could (Diamond Member).The hotel in general is quiet and clean and is situated to close to may amenities, on the large part due to Metrotown mall being 1/2 block away. The rooms were clean and comfortable as always. The room service, although slow, was also good, the person who came to deliver our food was quite friendly."
367619138,VCBCX1,Bc,2016-04-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent hotel, quiet room on an upper floor. Loved staying here away from the bustle of downtown Vancouver but handy to everything as long as you have a car - reasonable price for parking. Bathroom spacious and all well equipped. Would be good to have real milk for coffee instead of powered junk. "
152547135,VCBCX1,"BC, Canada",2013-02-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed one night with our dog. There was a package in the room for the dog with a bed, bowls and mat. A very pet friendly hotel and made us know it was more then alright that we did have a dog with us and that it was okay for her to be in the lobby etc. All the staff we had interactions with were the most friendly, kind people. Super impressed with the level of service. We did order room service for dinner and it was great! Would stay here again in a heart beat."
336108635,VCBCX1,"Beaverton, Oregon",2015-12-30,Vancouver X Inn,There is nothing in the world that the staff does not do for you. I have stayed in many hotels in usa but the service you get in Vancouver XT is phenomenal.  I got breakfast and evening snacks. It is so much . The pastry cakes are so nice . Thank you XT metro town. Very close to sky train . This skytrain will take you to all major places in Vancouver.  Will go back. 
182307834,VCBCX1,"Belen, United States",2013-10-24,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel has the best customer service I have ever experienced.  They were respectful, responsive and very helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in the area.  You won't be disappointed."
290116162,VCBCX1,"Belfast, United Kingdom",2015-07-18,Vancouver X Inn,Great hotel - rooms fabulous. Beds soooo comfy. Great views over city.  Short walk to sky train.  A bit of luxury during a touring holiday.A few pointers - not enough signage around the hotel to find where you are.  No signs in lift - difficult to get room key into lift selection floor - pool far too small for a hotel this size and also very difficult to find.Staff very friendly and helpful especially the lovely lady in executive lounge in an evening.
179664219,VCBCX1,"Bella Bella, Canada",2013-10-03,Vancouver X Inn,"What can I say?  The XT at Metrotown blew my expectations away.  From the booking process to the chocolate covered strawberries in the fridge and rose petals strewn about the room, The XT Metrotown made our wedding night a very memorable and relaxing experience.  I would strongly recommend this hotel."
278796223,VCBCX1,"Bellevue, Washington",2015-06-08,Vancouver X Inn,"We had a day's notice that the family was have a quick reunion in Vancouver at my sister's home. We needed a room night quickly and the XT was available. We stayed here last January and was greeted and given excellent service from the Front Desk, Concierge, Bellhop and the room service!! Great Breakfast buffet! I recommend this place!"
552587402,VCBCX1,"Bellingham, WA",2018-01-08,Vancouver X Inn,"We stay here overnight to go to a Canucks game, we were able to check-in early, walk around the area (including the nearby mall) and grab beverages in the Executive Lounge.  As Diamond members we also had access to a light dinner and full breakfast buffet.  The Skytrain was just a five-minute walk which we took to the hockey game: a cheap and efficient mode of travel. Staff were excellent and the early check-in was much appreciated.  Last but not least, our room had a great view of the nearby mountains."
392737274,VCBCX1,"Bellingham, Washington",2016-07-14,Vancouver X Inn,"For a high priced hotel I was disappointed.  Interactions with many of the hotel staff were off-putting.  Many need to be trained or re-trained in customer relations:  the room service waiter who asked me to do him a favor, the glacial front desk clerk, the mediocre food, the constant emails exhorting me to spend more and more money.  Generally the staff was timely except when i tried to do quick check-out over the phone and  gave up after several minutes when no on came on the line.  I did like getting a room number in advance.  But overall a disappointing experience for a high priced hotel in a so-so location.."
463383512,VCBCX1,"Bend, United States",2017-02-27,Vancouver X Inn,We recently stayed at this property and were happy with our overall experience.  I would recommend staying here for personal or business.  The room was comfortable and clean overall.  Not new - but maintained.  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.
348753677,VCBCX1,"Billings, United States",2016-02-17,Vancouver X Inn,The staff of this hotel was excellent. The hotel was clean and well cared for. They went over and beyond any expectation we had. They were accommodating and were actively looking to make our stay the most enjoyable possible.  We will definitely stay there again.
194568804,VCBCX1,"Birkirkara, Malta",2014-02-18,Vancouver X Inn,Stayed here for four nights.  It was a quite hotel and very clean.  Staff was very helpful...They offered a shuttle service to and back where I had to report for a workshop...  Situated 5min walk from the Mall and SkyTrain.
239602735,VCBCX1,"Blind Bay, Canada",2014-11-12,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent stay, with close proximity to shopping and conference site.  The room was comfortable and clean and offered for an enjoyable stay.  Buffet breakfast was a great addition with lots of options to choose from with fresh fruits and a mixture of hot dishes.  Would look at staying at this hotel again if the opportunity arose."
390256262,VCBCX1,"Bluffton, South Carolina",2016-07-07,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel was a great location for getting the feel of living in the Vancouver area and using the train railway downtown or to wherever! This XT is right across from a big Shopping Mall and train!
420174834,VCBCX1,"Bodmin, United Kingdom",2016-09-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed at XT Metrotown for a four day break. Ideal location for the train station to downtown Vancouver, 20 min ride, and also for the Metropolis Mall (400 shops and food stalls). Hotel room was quiet but pick the higher number rooms and the highest number you can get on the floor as the ice machine is close to the lower numbered rooms and is quite noisy.  The staff were keen to meet the needs of everyone, booking taxis, lending umbrellas, pointing out places to go, accommodating food requirements. Shusheel Prem was the perfect host and managed the arrival of about 50 guests, for an unexpected breakfast, with politeness and efficiency.  Only downside is the access to complimentary wifi which was very limited and would not support more than two mins without logging off. However, this was a minor point as we were on holiday.  A great stay."
249359763,VCBCX1,"Boise, Idaho",2015-01-14,Vancouver X Inn,"We have stayed here over Christmas the last couple of years visiting family and it has worked really well for us.  The hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from Metrotown which is really convenient, and the amenities and service are very good.  The rooms are spacious and well laid out, the onsite food options are good, although a touch pricey.  Being HH Gold, the Executive lounge on the 18th floor is a nice touch and the views over downtown Vancouver are fantastic.  The prices are pretty reasonable for a big city as well, although we generally use points accumulated over the year."
437606099,VCBCX1,"boise, United States",2016-11-15,Vancouver X Inn,"A great weekend of relaxation, shopping and eating.  The Asian market place (Crystal Mall) is a great place to grab a quick bite and shop for out of the ordinary items.  We love the Mall that is close by (Hudson Bay Company) -- "
622982837,VCBCX1,"Bologna, Italy",2018-10-07,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed in this hotel during a work trip, the staff was very nice and the room was large and very clean. The location was not particularly beautiful, but convenient to get to the train station. There are a couple of malls near by."
242332009,VCBCX1,"Bonners Ferry, Idaho",2014-12-01,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is right by Metro town and also the Sky Train.We were there for Grey Cup week-end, so the hotel was full of football fans, which added to the experience.  The staff was great. Under ground parking was only $11., which was very reasonable. The Lounge served wonderful food.Great place to stay for a couple of nights."
381778385,VCBCX1,"Bonnington, Canada",2016-06-11,Vancouver X Inn,"Staff are always friendly and helpful.  The hotel is located close to shopping, restaurants and public transportation.

586207944,VCBCX1,"Boston, Massachusetts",2018-06-09,Vancouver X Inn,The Metrotown XT is just a quick 15 ride or less to downtown Vancouver on the last hhtvrsilbwhichbid a half block away. Itâ€™s an excellent facility with a large mall almost across the street and a large beautiful park right next door. Very nice neighborhood. Lots of restaurants for dinner choices as well. Great facility with great staff. 
447274967,VCBCX1,"Boston, Massachusetts",2016-12-28,Vancouver X Inn,"A family friendly hotel with breath taking views and excellent food service. The suites are excellent choice if one is travelling with kids/teenagers. The location to major shopping areas and highway is a plus. Overall a very satisfying stay. The staff, Morekta, Arif, Raj and Leah all helped us making this trip memorable."
374113031,VCBCX1,"Bothell, Washington",2016-05-18,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is conveniently located to many of Vancouver' Eastern suburbs.There are some very good Chinese Restaurants in the area as well.The staff are friendly and very helpful.The view from the room was beautiful.My issues with this location is that at the $200 per night price range it is not quite &quot;there&quot;.The room was ice cold not matter what we set the heat to.  We had it set to 83f /28c and we froze.The bathroom, while attractive, had no water pressure and the tub/shower fixtures felt like they were going to pull off the wall.Over all a good hotel for business, yet priced a bit high. I would not reccomend it at all for families or a pleasure trip."
255119877,VCBCX1,"Bothell, Washington",2015-02-18,Vancouver X Inn,I travel half of my life for work. This stay happened to be for a little family vacation. The hotel is nice. The room we ordered was actually larger than expected. The images on the website were not very helpful in this regard so a pleasant surprise. I will say that for a XT it was probably one of the worst beds I have ever slept on. I woke up every morning with a sore lower back. The service was as expected from a XT.
281024091,VCBCX1,Bowling Green,2015-06-17,Vancouver X Inn,Just finished two great nights here. We were looking for a place to stay for the World Cup. The XT was reasonably priced and had king size suites that accommodated our family. The rooms were nice clean and spacious. Easy access to the Skytrain and two blocks from one of the largest malls that I have ever seen. I travel 2-3 times a month and I will say this hotel had the nicest most accommodating staff that I have ever experienced. When we arrived we needed a roll-a-way bed and once the gentleman from housekeeping brought it and saw our large family he went back and got us extra towels and toiletries without us even asking. The host/restaurant manager and the servers were spectacular as well as the front desk and bell service. There was a consistency from everyone that you rarely see these days. A job well done!  I would highly reccomend the XT!
195522028,VCBCX1,"Brampton, Canada",2014-02-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Very pleasant facility with excellent access to  restaurants and transit.

All staff are extremely courteous."
371072506,VCBCX1,"Brantford, Canada",2016-05-07,Vancouver X Inn,"Over-all, a comfortable peaceful stay.  Service everywhere from housekeeping to their Reflect restaurant to the front desk was prompt, cheerful and very helpful.  Shopping in the Metrotown complex, a 5-minute walk away. Same with the SkyTrain.  A good sized room with a luxurious, firm, king bed.  Predominantly urban downtown view from our 12th floor full wall window with a teaser view of Mt. Baker in the distance on clear days. Choose other than a &quot;corner&quot; room if a smaller bathroom would be a problem. Buffet breakfast was a tad pricey at total $23 per person with lots of fruit choices, pastry, egg, potato and perfect bacon.  Give it a go... we're glad we did!"
540683279,VCBCX1,"Brick, New Jersey",2017-11-13,Vancouver X Inn,"XT Vancouver Metrotown is convenient and clean.  The hotel is convenient to restaurants, the Mall and business in the city.

220087563,VCBCX1,"Bridgetown, Barbados",2014-08-06,Vancouver X Inn,"This property is conveniently located near (5 mins walk) to Metropolis at Metrotown Mall, and the Sky Train, it is also attached to a quaint Asian mall called the Crystal Mall which offers a wide selection of oriental cuisine. There are also a number of places of worship nearby or easily accessed via the Transit. The rooms are up to the usual high XT standard, and the Hotel was quite accommodating to travelers with late evening flights, allowing us to stay well pass the normal noon check out, we were also allowed to check-in to our room early (9:30AM). The on-premises restaurant Reflect is also a plus, and the staff friendly.Stayed post cruise for 2 days."
192280852,VCBCX1,"Bridport, United Kingdom",2014-01-27,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed for 2 nights with a room on the executive floor. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is well located for both metro town and the sky train. The room was immaculately clean, the bed was large and comfy but the bathroom was tiny and the view from the window was a building site. The nibbles in the executive room early evening was delicious but the breakfast was not up to much just the basic items.They did give us a very late check out as they were not busy but as gold members even though they weren't busy we didn't get a room upgrade."
449878690,VCBCX1,"Brisbane, Australia",2017-01-06,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice comfortable rooms with easy access to the shopping centre. Disappointing things are they do not have proper Tea making facility, which for a none coffee drinker is disappointing. Also the shower rose is too low in the bathroom once you set into the bath, it may be fine for smaller people but for somebody 6 foot and above it is difficult to get your head under the water especially if you want to warm up.The staff were very friendly, as expected.The rooms was clean and well stocked as expected.We would stay again if we are needing a place to stay without being in the downtown area."
214717603,VCBCX1,"Brisbane, australia",2014-07-10,Vancouver X Inn,There were great staff when we checked in and welcomed us and were very knowledgeable. Our room was a good size with all the amenities. It was on a good level too. The bed was good but the pillows were too soft for us. The parking was paid Parking but you can go in anytime. It was very close to a shopping mall and a Chinese shopping street.
251601386,VCBCX1,"Bristol, United Kingdom",2015-01-29,Vancouver X Inn,"Clean, warm, comfortable and friendly staff - yes! But surely a 4 star hotel shouldn't need to charge for wi-fi and at their very expensive prices I would have expected breakfast to have been included (if it was, we were not told!!!)."
427255602,VCBCX1,British Columbia,2016-10-11,Vancouver X Inn,I was fortunate enough to be at a 2 day conference at this XT so my face was a familiar one to the staff during our stay.  I also conveniently wore a name tag for the convention and found that the staff were kind enough to use my name while looking for ways to engage in conversation (from the catering crew to the janitorial staff).  The food was great and the facility was super clean.  3 cheers to you all for the great overall experience!
213694415,VCBCX1,"British Columbia, Canada",2014-07-04,Vancouver X Inn,I had booked a room for 4 people (my 3 daughters and I) and had booked 2 Queen beds. When I checked in they wanted to give me 1 king bed. That was straightened out while we went shopping at Metrotown. The room was clean but only 3 towels for 4 people.  I phoned the front desk to ask what the wifi password was - I was informed that wifi was an extra $8.00 per night. I am actually quite shocked at this - I have stayed in many hotels and haven't been charged for wifi in years. Seemed like another cash grab in an already pricey hotel. It's back to the Coast Plaza for us!
200412003,VCBCX1,"British Columbia, Canada",2014-04-08,Vancouver X Inn,I stayed for meetings.  The staff was pleasant and helpful and did a great job at serving food to a large group in a short time.  The food was quite good for the circumstances.  The rooms are a little tired - worn upholstery and carpet - but are clean and comfortable.  The king suite had a small fridge and wired internet connection.  The queen rooms should also include fridges for the price and there should be free wifi in the rooms.  The buffet breakfast was nice but overpriced.  Location is convenient to Metrotown and the sky train.
415765131,VCBCX1,"British Columbia, Canada",2016-09-07,Vancouver X Inn,"We have stayed here several times over the years and are always happy to come. The hotel is typical XT but the friendly staff, free newspapers, nice exercise room and location always add to the experience. The valet parking is cheap at $19 and the bell boys/ valet are a credit to the hotel. I have mentioned on several previous hotel reviews that you only get one chance to make a first impression and our arrival/ check in was exemplary. The rooms are spacious, clean and equipped with coffee makers."
219939852,VCBCX1,"British Columbia, Canada",2014-08-05,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a great hotel to stay at.  Clean rooms, friendly staff, and close to the skytrain.  Also within walking distance of Metrotown.  I have stayed at this hotel several times while in the Lower Mainland and never leave disapointed.  Considering the price of a room, they could offer free WiFi and cut the customer a break on parking, which is 11.00 a night."
342410896,VCBCX1,"British Columbia, Canada",2016-01-24,Vancouver X Inn,"As far as large chain hotels go, the XT Vancouver Metrotown serves its purpose well. The room was modest but very comfortable and impeccably clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the meeting services worked well. I would definitely return for business but read my review on the Reflect restaurant at the hotel. "
245188651,VCBCX1,"British Columbia, Canada",2014-12-19,Vancouver X Inn,I have stayed at the XT many times over the years and have never been disappointed.

This Hotel is first class in every respect.
345096154,VCBCX1,"British Columbia, Canada",2016-02-04,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice rooms with comfortable beds. Coffee maker in the room. Lots of bathroom amenities. My wife and I stayed on a business trip and they upgraded us to a suite. The room was huge. Parking is extra (self-park or valet available), but that is par for the course in the Vancouver area. Reasonably priced."

Love the location and hotel.Tansportation from the airport is by taxi or other local means only and although we read online the hotel had a shuttle to the terminal, this turned out not to be the case. Flat rate $35 downtown.Hotel check-in and staff were excellent! The lounge and restaurant was perfect. A nice variety of local craft beers, solid and delicious food and fun!There are a variety of shops and restaurants nearby including a Starbucks in the small mall across the street.Thanks, XT!"
344421989,VCBCX1,Bruges,2016-02-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Not my first stay in this hotel, but as my XT status changed at start 2016, i booked back this hotel with the advantage being very close to a customer for business reason.Even i had never complaints in the past, this time i could enjoy the lounge access and an upgraded room (2rooms concept, 1 with bed other room more sitting TV room). Choice of food and drinks in lounge was impressive.Of course, i also realize that these options are not for everybody but in all these hotel programs and lounge possibilities, this one is great.In addtion to say that room accomodation and bedcomfort are 100% ok, and staff very friendly.Maybe a bit far for vancouver city centre, although you have the skyline, and in close neighborhood plenty of shopping places."
489782935,VCBCX1,"Bruges, Belgium",2017-06-02,Vancouver X Inn,"We had a normal suite in this hotel which was a very nice room. Bedroom seperated from the living room helped us survive the 9 hour jetlag (my wife could continue sleeping while I was restless during middle of the night).The hotel is very close to the very big mall metrotown and downtown Vancouver is easily reachable with the skytrain. The station of the skytrain is about 300 meters from the hotel.Lobby personnel and breakfast people extremely friendly. Also the executive lounge was a very nice feature to have.Rooms are very good sound proofed and totally no wear and tear has been found in our room.We used this hotel as a prÃ© cruise stay (cruise terminal in Vancouver is a disaster, worst we have ever travelled from) and were very happy with this hotel. If you take daytours most companies come to find you in your hotel, also in Burnaby, so no issue it's not downtown."

This hotel is located in the Chinese community area of Burnaby, but has easy skytrain access within a 5 minute walk to the Waterfront area in Vancouver where you can visit all the main attractions. The hotel is excellent despite having to be moved from our noisy bedroom due to a family with kids next door and construction outside. However, Arif on the Reception desk duly resolved the issue and also gave us full access to having breakfast in their main restaurant as well as the Executive lounge, where Suman gave us excellent service."
548231948,VCBCX1,"Buena Vista, Colorado",2017-12-20,Vancouver X Inn,The staff here is wonderful. Everyone remembers your name. The location is close to shopping and the metro to take to downtown in minutes. They have a great bar and restaurant with excellent food.  We had a lovely view from our room up on the 16th floor. The room was very clean with a very comfortable bed. We will definitely stay here again when in town. 
305409934,VCBCX1,"Buford, Georgia",2015-08-31,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff here is amazing, so friendly and helpful all the time. Stayed here for 4 nights and toured the city. Very close to the train station, 20 min ride to town. If you are in need of a car, there is a zipcar location right around the corner for a day trip. Rooms are clean, modern and well taken care of."
301279243,VCBCX1,"Burlington, Canada",2015-08-19,Vancouver X Inn,My husband and I stayed here July 18 to July 20th.  We were visiting Vancouver to attend a Retirement Dinner for one of my husband's colleagues.  The hotel was a short drive from the airport and from downtown Vancouver.  The hotel was also a short walk to Metrotown mall which turned out to be very handy.  We had a nice breakfast in the Hotel restaurant.  The room was spacious and very clean.  Our room faced the pool and this seemed quieter than other rooms would have been. The hotel itself was very busy as it was hosting a couple of weddings and a party in their reception rooms. I would certainly recommend this hotel if you want to be in a quieter location than in Central Vancouver.
282279446,VCBCX1,"Burlington, Canada",2015-06-22,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is conveniently located in Burnaby, BC and close to most of the business areas.  Rooms are small but typical for a large downtown city  core. Parking is easy and convenient and reasonably priced. Service is what you'd expect from a 'Hotel' style property."
368555928,VCBCX1,Burnaby,2016-04-28,Vancouver X Inn,"Decent spot. I just wasn't impressed when someone was banging at the door hollering &quot;Room Service over and over until I went to the door. He said my hamburger was ready and he was delivering it. I was in bed sleeping and hand't ordered any room service but he was insistent that I had. He was so insistent I decided to call the front desk to speak with the manager on duty. I was told he wasn't available at that time and was put on hold. After waiting I decided to just forget it and go back to bed/sleep.  About 15 minutes later my phone rings and I get up to go answer it and there in nobody there. I called the front desk and asked if they had called my room and hung up and they advised they had. Also, wanted to know if I wanted to now speak with the manager! After being awakened twice I informed them to just forget it and that I wanted to get some sleep.I travel on business a lot and never have had this happen.Very poor customer service."
416993965,VCBCX1,Burnaby,2016-09-10,Vancouver X Inn,"For my family and me, what we need is just good wifi, nice bed, neat room and convenient traffic. XT reached all these requirements so we are satisfied. BTW, the building is just near the Metrotown."
381000157,VCBCX1,"Burnaby, British Columbia",2016-06-08,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff is friendly. No complimentary breakfast and the restaurant at tHe hotel was very expensive. There is a buffet for $22. I don't eat that much for it to be worth it. Happy hour food, had to buy, was good such as wings and nachos. Nice outdoor Patio off tHe restaurant. The pool was small. It is a lap pool and was very dirty. We spent the time in the kiddy pool which was warm and pleasant. No airport shuttle so taxi is 30 one way. All there is is Chinese stores. There is a huge mall walking distance but if you want groceries I didn't find anything. The transit is very close so you can hop on but if you want to get a quick bite to eat or an ice cream snack you are out of luck. "
397007016,VCBCX1,"Burnaby, Canada",2016-07-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Our room was quiet, clean and comfortable.  The location was convenient for us being halfway between downtown Vancouver and Simon Fraser University campus in Burnaby.  There were a number of good restaurants within walking distance and the Sky Train was close by.  The staff was helpful during check in and we were met at the door by Valet parking who was more than willing to park our vehicle or explained that we were welcome to do it ourself if we preferred.  My only complaint about our stay was the free internet was terrible.  It was slow and kept kicking us out.  I tried accessing it through XT Honours as well as through the freebie site given to us upon check in. Neither worked well."
628318503,VCBCX1,"Burnaby, Canada",2018-10-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Have stayed here a few times now. My favorite hotel in Burnaby because of its location. Very conveniently attached to the crystal mall which has the best food court for authentic Chinese food in Burnaby. The rooms are okay, nice but older, could be modernized.  The lounge is decent with good selection of snacks and drinks. Breakfast buffet average. "

235825540,VCBCX1,"Burnaby,, Canada",2014-10-22,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at this Hotel for 3 weeks and the services are excellent. I got upgraded to an executive suite and it was very nice. For the second week, since the Hotel was full I could only find rooms for a couple of days. But when I asked the staff, they were very helpful in finding me rooms for two additional days at a lower price!   The breakfast selection both on the 18th floor and in the restuarant is very extensive (for a vegetarian)  The location is also very central both to offices in Burnaby, the airport and Downtown Vancouver.  I would recommend this hotel for all business travellers."
156033239,VCBCX1,Cairns,2013-03-29,Vancouver X Inn,"I must admit when I booked this hotel, I had no idea this was not in downtown Vancouver. That turned out not be an issue at all, close to everything we needed, sky train, mall and great restaurants. The staff are wonderful, was upgraded to a one bedroom suite with amazing views over the snow covered mountains. Lounge staff beyond helpful with tours and bookings. Looking forward to returning soon"

438629517,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2016-11-19,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference in Vancouver. I had stayed here before so I knew what to expect and the hotel did not disappoint. The hotel is in Burnaby but is just a short drive (or train ride) to Vancouver and is much cheaper than the hotels downtown. My room was comfortable and spacious. Wireless internet was free with good strength and service. The pool and hot tub were nice ways to relax at the end of the day. Parking was $12/night and was underground. The only issue is that it is connected to the mall parking and the traffic can be a bit hectic. Room service was okay but quite expensive for what you get. As well, the selection is limited especially if you are staying for a long period of time (I was here for a week). The restaurant and lounge are okay but again expensive with small portion sizes. Overall though, I had a great stay and would recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to Vancouver or area."
223879465,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2014-08-23,Vancouver X Inn,"I have stayed at the XT Metrotown twice for business and quite enjoyed it.  The front desk agent Benjamin was very friendly and always willing to help.  The bell boys were also very friendly.  The rooms are clean, bed is comfortable and bathroom has all the right amenities.  I did find the room quite small and was able to see hallway light by my bed which was a bit distracting.What I did find irritating was the parking situation.  There is a cost for parking. but the irritation comes with driving into the parking lot as it is shared with a mall.  It's very congested and you need to ensure you are on your A game in order to not scrape a wall.  I will stay there again, but will likely take a cab.Also, a few of my coworkers were charged for internet and parking, even though, under our corporate rate it was to be removed off their bill. Just be mindful and read over your bill before checking out."

Excellent customer service with all the amenities a business traveler requires.Spacious rooms with great views are what to expect to help you unwind. The valet service is outstanding with a great selection of food and drinks in the lounge and restaurant. The executive lounge on the 18th floor is very nice, both in the late afternoon and morning. If you want to go off site, there are great restaurants within a couple of blocks and also has great shopping as well. Location is close to getting into the downtown Vancouver area.Great place to stay for business or personal time...."
461973980,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2017-02-22,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel was very nice.I used the new online check in and had the opportunity to pick my room and enter my credit card information. The system put me on the 10th floor and I did have an option to stay on the second, I opted for the 10th. The elevators were fast, this was a beef of mine with a Winnipeg hotel.The room was what you would expect from a downtown classy hotel. 2 queen beds, a desk. Everything seemed clean and tidy. The bathroom door kept closing so that was a bit annoying, but not enough to influence my rating. I did not use any of the amenities.There was a mini mall around, and a shopping center so this hotel was close enough to walk to."
157320514,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2013-04-10,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed for 5 days for business. The lobby smells of the open food market that the hotel shares its property with.  No fridge in my room to keep things cold, the tv service cut in and out and was very user unfriendly( had no idea what was on , no guide) wifi costs $8/day/device but its free at the local dive restaurant across the street... I ask for a quiet room, I got one right beside the elevator and the fitness room is about 12x14 and is a dark and closed off room, the lap pool was drained and the hot tub was cloudy, no way was I going in there.  Carefully while parking, I was almost hit 3 times coming around the corners."
341083582,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2016-01-18,Vancouver X Inn,"I write this as a XT Honours Diamond Member - This was the second time here in two months, stayed on the 10th floor, good view, next to Metro Town mall and two blocks from Skytrain, so I saved the $12 parking fee and used Skytrain. The executive lounge on the 18th floor has a nice view, evening food was nice, staff could be a bit friendlier. Check in and out was great. Nice beds, hallway very noisy in the morning when maid service is going in and out of rooms and the loud hallway talk. For a XT with access to the Executive floor it was good value"
409051389,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2016-08-22,Vancouver X Inn,"We had a wedding at a nearby venue and stayed 3 nights here. I was welcomed by the nicest young lady and checked in immediately. There is a mall right across the street from the hotel that offers any type of shopping you could ever want. And restaurants galore....anything your heart desires is nearby. Very nice rooms for a relatively nice price. Probably the best I have ever been treated at a hotel. 3 days later when I checked out the same young lady remembered my name, my room number and the occasion I was there for. Incredible service."
195515862,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2014-02-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Great location and great hotel room, made even better with a lovely view of the mountains.  The best part of our stay was the great guest service that we received from the front desk.  Wilson and Stephanie were very helpful and attentive.  They wre both very personable and gave me great advice as to where to go and most importantly - where to eat.It's people like them that make hotels and trips memorable and I want to thank them for making our trip great!  You should hire more people like them at the hotel :)"
419365469,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2016-09-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Staff not polite. Would not resolve the issues for you. Heating did not work and it was cold like anything. The HVAC system (When it was running) sounded like Fighter Jet engines running. Staff provided me with an electric heater that was in miserable condition. When asked if that is all they will do to fix the issue , it was a cold yes (not even polite). It was freezing all night long and I was scared all night long that the room might lose all the oxygen."
570872425,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2018-04-03,Vancouver X Inn,"The convenient location of this hotel is very beneficial for travelers wishing to quickly access any form of transportation and is well situated for good shopping. There was nothing outstanding about the hotel but it was clean, comfortable and the staff was friendly and helpful. The only issue we had was key cards but the hotel plans to go to digital access so will hopefully remove those issues. We would stay at this hotel again."
232462704,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2014-10-03,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed here on the company's dime, so my room choice was pretty good.  There is an business lounge that I had access to that was included with the room price that provided a breakfast and drinks anytime I wanted.  The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean.  There is the Metropolis at Metrotown mall and many restaurants in the area to choose from.  I would stay here again the next time I am on business in Burnaby."
555519189,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2018-01-22,Vancouver X Inn,"Was staying for business and this hotel was located well.  I normally stay downtown, but this is closer to my work location.  The neighborhood is okay - not great for walking (at least by comparison to downtown).  I have to say the staff were incredibly friendly during my visit.  Everyone had a smile and a pleasant greeting for me... and after long stressful days it is refreshing to come &quot;home&quot; to happy people."
556389527,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2018-01-25,Vancouver X Inn,"It has all the convenience that you can expect from XT Hotel.  The hotel is situated near Metrotown which is one of the largest shopping mall in Vancouver.  It is also connected to a Crystal Mall which has some Chinese food and shopping.  However, parking at XT will cost you $16 per night and even after paying it is rather difficult to look for a parking lot.  The service of the hotel is very good."
376628425,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2016-05-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Need to update in room and business centre internet as the internet was as bad as the days of dial up. Room was roomy and clean and staff service was good except the internet part. Self serve parking was very confusing, and it takes two different elevators to go from your car to your room. Location is close to the train which makes it easy to get downtown and back. I would rate the Hotel as 3.5 stars"
397082184,VCBCX1,"Calgary, Canada",2016-07-25,Vancouver X Inn,If you stay at this hotel you can walk to one of the largest malls in Canada! The Metrotown Mall will take more than 2 hours to see everything. You can also take the wonderful Sky Train from there on a day pass to get to almost anywhere in Vancouver but the best place for us was Watertown!  There you will find a very large steam clock that goes off every 15 minutes BUT the best time is on the hour!

The food was great, and although the space was a wee bit tight, the staff made up for it. The room was quiet, clean and elevators did not pose a problem.  I recommend staying here.  The view from the room was great, and the barbeque on Saturday was awesome. Steve who works in the bar is a keeper, terrific service above and beyond.

I will try a hotel downtown next time and see if they have additional charges for wireless."
158263660,VCBCX1,Canada,2013-04-20,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a great hotel for those who are conducting business in Burnaby. Clean, reasonably priced rooms, and very close to shopping and restaurants. The staff are very friendly and quite helpful. Very close to a Skytrain stop, too. All things considered, an excellent hotel."
197802956,VCBCX1,Canada,2014-03-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Very clean, great staff. Stay here always when travelling to Burnaby.  In house restaurant is very good, and close to a number of great restaurants, as well as a walk across the street to the Metrotown mall."
431211134,VCBCX1,Canada Victoria ,2016-10-24,Vancouver X Inn,"Rooms are clean,comfortable beds ,staff very helpful,location close to shopping mall,coffee shops walking distance to metro,definitely will recommend this hotel.Internet is a bit slow in room other than that pretty good  "
169335071,VCBCX1,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",2013-07-27,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at this hotel pre and post our recent Alaskan cruise in June. We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and welcoming. Elizabeth on the front desk did her level best to obtain information for us about our cruise ship terminal and arranged an early check in for us. The hotel is located about a 10 min walk from a huge shopping mall, where you can buy almost anything also underneath the hotel is a Chinese market selling all manner of amazing stuff. We ordered room service on our first evening and it arrived quickly and was very tasty and good value for money. The hotel has pay per view movies and we watched one of the latest releases. We did have some minor issues; however, they were dealt with in a very professional manner by Chris Perna, the Director of rooms. In summary I am glad we chose this hotel and will visit again, the next time we are in Vancouver"
481141294,VCBCX1,"Carlsbad, California",2017-05-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Very convenient location, 25 minutes to downtown. If you rent a car only 20 minutes to the airport. Leave the car and 2 blocks walk to Skytrain to go to the city center and avoid the parking hassle. Very frequent train service. One change connects to the airport train.  Two block from the Metrotown mall."
268991524,VCBCX1,"Castlegar, Canada",2015-04-29,Vancouver X Inn,"Helpful staff, clean room, comfortable bed. Within walking distance to the metrotown mall and skytrain. Low headroom for underground parking, so trucks and large SUV's take note. Easy to find location."
385105802,VCBCX1,"Cedar City, Utah",2016-06-22,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is located next to a big shopping mall. It has a shared underground  parking. We got an executive suite beautiful view from our room. Love their bedding and sheets. The executive lounge was a total disappointment  this space is usually used to work or have a drink in this case this particular one looked like a pajama party with children everywhere, not at all what we are use to with this hotel chain. The hotel staff is not friendly or helpful  only concierge had a smile. Their price range is very high and there are many other choices with better customer service. Many trips to different countries with the same chain and this is definitely the location that will never come back to."
377586619,VCBCX1,"Cedar City, Utah",2016-05-29,Vancouver X Inn,Front desk staff is not friendly or helpful at all. At check in I requested a local map and they didn't even show me the hotel on the map. I also wanted to exchange some spending money in local currency and that really became to be an inconvenience for the staff. Executive Lounge is crowded with Toddlers and is to small.
558156340,VCBCX1,Central Coast ,2018-02-03,Vancouver X Inn,The early morning construction noise was a clear issue but we were not warned of this when we booked or prior to staying.  There was no porter service available and I had to source our own bag trolley for our bags and equipment. No questions if we need assistance from staff.Location was close to the Sky Train which was very useful.  Rooms were just ok...
180327363,VCBCX1,"Chapel Hill, North Carolina",2013-10-09,Vancouver X Inn,XT Vancouver Metrotown is spacious for family of four and clean. Hotel is in the center of the town and connected to the a Chinese food court which we enjoyed the most. Also a bank near by I did get money I needed without driving.      
608898278,VCBCX1,"Charleston, South Carolina",2018-08-21,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed here on XT points.  Many of the reviews say the location is great.  For us it was not great.  Was conveniently located near the skyway - but for a family of four the skyway was expensive to commute back and forth.   The staff were friendly and helpful.  We did have some trouble with our room - the AC did not work well and was quite warm in the rooms making sleeping difficult.  The breakfast was good.  The hotel photos make the hotel look a bit more grander than it is.
396939982,VCBCX1,"Charlotte, North Carolina",2016-07-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Having all downtown hotels sold out, I moved a bit out of the city towards Burnaby..The XT Metrotown is very close the a huge mall &quot;Metrotown&quot;, close to the Skyline, which is very convenient and close to a lot of restaurants. The room rates are ridiculous expensive a for the value you get. Overall hotel staff is friendly and helpful, housekeeping does a good job, no complaints at all but the rest is just average. The room furniture is crying for an update, the carpet looks dirty and very aged, the &quot;pool area and pool&quot; it's just enough for max 4 people, health room is poor equipped and without any windows, Breakfast is not complimentary and they charge you 21.00$ for the buffet. Overall I felt the room rate I paid was more for the location and surrounding instead for service and nice room. I really do not believe I will come back."
523427689,VCBCX1,"Charlotte, North Carolina",2017-09-08,Vancouver X Inn,"After a lovely Alaskan cruise, we stayed at the XT Metrotown in Vancouver. We were given an upgraded suite. The experience was lovely. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. It's a quick sky-train ride to the downtown area."
385455017,VCBCX1,"Charlotte, United States",2016-06-20,Vancouver X Inn,We came to Vancouver for a vacation (my husband and I) and we chose this hotel for the price (cheaper than staying downtown) and the location to the buses and SkyTrain.  It's literally a 5-7 min walk to the Skytrain and bus station.  We used all public transportation to get around the city - and it was so easy.  In addition - there is a mall next door with a great food court and lots of stores.  Location is key for this hotel!
168259160,VCBCX1,"Charlotte, United States",2013-07-19,Vancouver X Inn,Overall good experience.  The staff was extremely professional and helpful.  The room was comfortable. Was expecting to be in the city but pulic transportation is close and available.  The Shopping Mall next door provided a nice diversion.
389270256,VCBCX1,"Charlotte, United States",2016-07-04,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here as a transition to a cruise trip.  The location was extremely convenient to transportation options, food and shopping for those last minute items.  The hotel was fresh and clean.  Loved our stay."
212177863,VCBCX1,"Charlottesville, Virginia",2014-06-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Enjoyed two nights in a first class hotel with a friendly helpful staff. The room was immaculate and elegant, with a terrific panoramic view of the city and mountains. There was convenient self-parking under the hotel for $9 per night. Had a very good late dinner in the hotel the night we arrived. The surrounding blocks are filled with restaurants and shops, and the skytrain and bus service is nearby. There is a bustling Asian market adjacent to the hotel. The hotel is at the intersection of several main roads that will take you to major destinations. Will definitely return."
166934760,VCBCX1,"Chicago, Illinois",2013-07-09,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed four nights at the XT.  Location is convenient, walking distance to the sky train.  We paid for a one bedroom suite, and I was disappointed that even though I was a Diamond member, we didn't receive any kind of room upgrade, not even to the Executive floor.  The suite was comfortable but oddly laid out.  Large living room but sparsely furnished (couch and chair were a little worn), and the bedroom was very small.  There was little room to walk around in the bedroom with the king size bed.  Bathroom was small.  The lounge on the top floor had a very nice view.  Food in the lounge was good, but the space is small.  Several mornings we couldn't find seating space, so we ate standing up or sat on the window ledge.  This hotel didn't feel like a XT to me; felt like it should've been a class lower."
420505367,VCBCX1,"Chicago, Illinois",2016-09-20,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is conveniently located with proximity access to downtown Vancouver and other areas of British Columbia. The check-in process went very smoothly, and we were settled in our room in no time. There is a fee for the underground parking, but it was very reasonable.My husband and I upgraded to a king size executive room, which allowed us access to the lounge on the 18th floor. The room itself was large and clean, and since we were located on the 17th floor we also had a nice view.The Wi-Fi in the room worked with no issues whatsoever.As far as the lounge goes, it was just OK. For whatever reason, I was expecting something else. The evening appetizers were basic, breakfast seemed to be a little better.The check-out was friendly and efficient."
477837818,VCBCX1,"Chicago, Illinois",2017-04-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Not much to this hotel. It has all the amenities you need and a Chinese food court that's attached to it. Comfort - 4A typical hotel that does keeps to the XT standard. Location - 4A 30 min drive from downtown Vancouver but you have everything you need in walking distance. It's in a Chinatown so you can get your fill of Chinese foodMisc - 3Had a long hair hanging from a &quot;clean&quot; towel, not pleasant. Will be back for a inexpensive stay in Vancouver. "
400553251,VCBCX1,"Chicago, Illinois",2016-08-02,Vancouver X Inn,"I had a good stay at the XT Metrotown.  Note that it's not in the hot area by the water, more of an urban location (but still safe).  If you're Chinese or just love the food then this may be a great place for you as there's a really nice Chinese mall right outside the side door.  There's a good grocery store across the street as well as a large mall.  The hotel itself is pretty quiet, nicely appointed and the staff is friendly."
413632251,VCBCX1,"Chicago, Illinois",2016-09-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Quick 2 night business trip.  As previously mentioned, not in Vancouver but close.  Attached to an Asian mall and 5 minutes to the huge Mall Metropolis.  Great restaurant walking distance - Cactus Club Cafe.  Close to grocery store as well.  Very nice rooms and Ben at the front desk was super helpful.  Great customer service.  Super tiny &quot;fitness center&quot; but great pool and hot tub!  And excellent executive lounge!"
417153389,VCBCX1,"Chicago, Illinois",2016-09-11,Vancouver X Inn,"This XT was in an excellent location, about a 15 minute taxi ride from the Amtrak station, a 3 minute walk to about 3 malls, and 3 minute walk to public transportation (train station and bus terminal) which gets you to downtown( One Canada Place, tours buses, the Gas light district ) in about 10-15 minutes."
416181752,VCBCX1,"Chicago, Illinois",2016-09-08,Vancouver X Inn,"For the amount of money that you pay for this hotel, I'd expect the plumbing to work.  If there are not many guests using water, the sink and tub give you extremely hot water and nothing else.  I find that explanation be unacceptable."
544092360,VCBCX1,"Chicago, Illinois",2017-11-29,Vancouver X Inn,The staff was nice specially night shift manager and crew were best the know how to treat them guest right way I think some hotel need to learn from them and they have best food quality and the room was super clean thank you!
453259645,VCBCX1,"Chicago, United States",2017-01-18,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel was located in a convenient location just minutes from light rail, shopping, and dining.  It is across from Metropolis which has over 400 shops and restaurants.  Easy access to downtown Vancouver for sighseeing.  The Sunday brunch buffet was fairly priced with many options/variety."
205754593,VCBCX1,"chicago, United States",2014-05-15,Vancouver X Inn,"Large, clean, and luxurious room. The bed was heavenly making it easy to fall asleep. The menu offering for dinner in the hotel restaurant was lacking. Free internet service was flawless. The HVAC was quiet and kept the room comfortable"
290006475,VCBCX1,Chilliwack,2015-07-13,Vancouver X Inn,"I use the XT Metrotown while on business every 3 months or so.  Staff are always friendly, professional and attend to my every need.  The rooms and beds are clean and very comfortable.  Room service (meals) are quick, hot and very tasty!  No hesitation recommending XT Metrotown."
240648070,VCBCX1,"Chilliwack, Canada",2014-11-19,Vancouver X Inn,"The room was not well equipped for a handicapped  person, it needs better handicapped accessibility. Other than that it wasn't a bad place to stay. If you do need a place that caters to a handicapped person it is not good. I needed a parking spot near the elevator and they could not help me."
347043868,VCBCX1,"Chilliwack, Canada",2016-02-11,Vancouver X Inn,Great location near Metrotown and close to downtown Vcr. The staff is excellent and go the extra mile to make a good stay experience. The rates for the 1 bedroom suite on the executive floor were excellent and would recommend this hotel for couples taking a break.
215475876,VCBCX1,"Chilliwack, Canada",2014-07-14,Vancouver X Inn,Housekeeping staff walked in my room at 8am when I was still checked in the hotel.  Scared the heck out of me.  Disorganized and should not have happened. The manager offended me to the point of putting me in tears and made it seem like it was my fault.
344894619,VCBCX1,"Chilliwack, Canada",2016-02-03,Vancouver X Inn,Had an excellent stay. Sunday brunch was wonderful. Staff were courteous. Check-in and check-out was rapid with no problems. Hotel is surrounded by great restaurants and shopping. Access to transportation into Vancouver close by.
564022850,VCBCX1,"Chilliwack, Canada",2018-03-03,Vancouver X Inn,Hotel is always clean and quiet down side is the hot tub is outside and way to small for the amount of guests at the hotel it is always full.  Walking distance to everything food shopping and the sky train.  
202509918,VCBCX1,"chilliwack, Canada",2014-04-23,Vancouver X Inn,"welcomed right away and was in my room within 10 minutes of my arrival and the room was impeccably clean and the quietness of my room is and was amazing, I enjoy staying there I always have a great rest"
215817795,VCBCX1,"Citrus Heights, California",2014-07-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Beautiful hotel. close to the Metro mall,( across the street). The asian market at the Crystal mall is attached to the Hotel and  Large choice of restaurants in the area.Only downer I had here was when I ordered room service I was putr on hold for about 4 minutes each time I called. But if you you dont mind waiting the food is good."
294428049,VCBCX1,"Cleburne, Texas",2015-07-31,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is 30 minutes from the airport but very reasonably priced,   It was very clean.  The executive floor lounge was well stocked.  The most important thing was how friendly and helpful the entire staff were.  We had a good meal in the restaurant.  Very nice."
281291163,VCBCX1,"CobbleHill, Canada",2015-06-10,Vancouver X Inn,"Great service, friendly staff and clean quiet room.  I really appreciated the valet parking. The food and service in the restaurant was excellent.  I arrived long after lunch but was able to get wonderful food and great service in the bar (the chicken salad sandwich was the BEST!).  I really enjoyed my stay."
232336911,VCBCX1,"Cochrane, Canada",2014-10-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Good facility, but quite a distance from Downtown and the west side. For those who want to experience the hot spots in Vancouver, it is about a $40.00 taxi ride or more.  It is also quite a distance from the airport so not that accessible for travellers.  The area has mostly oriental restaurants and shops in the mall in the lbottom of the Hotel.  Driving distance to the Ferries is also at least 1/2 hour away as Vancouver does not have a freeway system.  The go train station to downtown is close the hotel and this is an option for those who do not want to drive in the city."
160675320,VCBCX1,"Coeur d Alene, United States",2013-05-10,Vancouver X Inn,"The stay was an outstanding experience, which included eating lunch and dinner at the Restaurant.  We had a high level mini-suite.  The staff was helpful, cordial and a pleasant experience.  The only disappointment was the need to pay for internet access."
540798296,VCBCX1,"Coeur d Alene, United States",2017-11-13,Vancouver X Inn,"We enjoyed the friendly staff.Service was excellent.  The upgrade package was an exceptional value.  The food included was better than expected, with a wide variety.The overall experience was excellent.  We will be back."
472820855,VCBCX1,"Coldstream, Canada",2017-04-04,Vancouver X Inn,"We enjoy the Burnaby XT.  The hotel is nicely appointed, rooms are very pleasant and comfortable, and the staff is always efficient and friendly.  We also enjoyed a really excellent buffet dinner in the hotel."
398148191,VCBCX1,"Coleraine, United Kingdom",2016-07-27,Vancouver X Inn,"Okay, so this hotel is a bit hard to find and from the outside isn't much to look at. Located in the business district of Vancouver it is very handy to the SKYLINE, and incredibly cheap and convenient way to get around Vancouver, you don't need a taxi within the zones, a bit like London - just buy a day pass.     The rooms are fairly large and the bed was big and very comfy. We had a fridge and good size bathroom in the room as well as a good size TV (but a bedroom is for one of two things, one is sleeping).     The staff were polite, friendly, helpful and the hotel had lots of guides to what to do in Vancouver.     I would stay here again, the big pull for me is it's convenience to transport to the rest of Vancouver."
314182511,VCBCX1,Colorado,2015-09-27,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed for 5 nights while in town for meetings.  The accommodations were excellent, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  I had meetings downtown in Vancouver, and access to the SkyTrain was close and convenient.  I would recommend highly."
220287669,VCBCX1,Columbia,2014-08-07,Vancouver X Inn,"Location: I booked this hotel under the impression that it was in Vancouver, as it is called XT Vancouver Metrotown. However, it is not in Vancouver, but instead Burnaby, which can be a 30-45 minute drive away depending on traffic. "
298131056,VCBCX1,"Columbus, Ohio",2015-08-11,Vancouver X Inn,"XT Vancouver Metroland BC is an excellent place to stay in Burnaby. Incredible, friendly and accommodating staff that gives solo, lady travelers their utmost attention. This location is within walking distance to the Metropolis Mall and the train that will take you directly to Vancouver. There are some great restaurants with walking distance, as well."
443297493,VCBCX1,"Columbus, Ohio",2016-12-10,Vancouver X Inn,Had a short 2 night stay for business. Was greater in a very positive manner. Got me to my room quickly. The room was very clean and comfortable. Internet connection was good. The hotel is walking distant to good restaurants. Was quiet and comfortable for resting and sleeping. Would definitely come back.
396453436,VCBCX1,"Colwood, Canada",2016-07-24,Vancouver X Inn,"We got married at this hotel three years ago in July.We had a great time.We had a very pleasant experience with the food, service and they did everything to accommodate our needs and requests for our dinner reception. The catering manager was extremely friendly and helpful. We were invited to a sampler dinner to try out the food before our wedding.The room needs a bit of reno for sure.Our room is huge. It's located at a very central area yet away from Vancouver downtown. Its good for tourists who do not want to rent a car.You can easily hop on sky train and go anywhere in burnaby or Vancouver "
305507262,VCBCX1,"Comox, Canada",2015-08-31,Vancouver X Inn,"I recently spent 3 nights at the XT,as always the service was great. During this stay the power was out due to storms for over 20 hours, the management and staff need to be commened for all the extra hard work and effort that was put in. They made sure everyone had flashlights, water and did some wonderful buffets for all people staying at the hotel. That extra effort goes a long way ."
348751413,VCBCX1,"Comox, Canada",2016-02-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Love the XT Hotel at Metrotown. Close to all shopping amenities, skytrain to downtown, and restaurants. Rooms are a good size with a chaise chair and desk. Very nice and clean rooms. Staff was very friendly and polite."
160659048,VCBCX1,"Coquitlam, Canada",2013-05-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Although not located in a &quot;glitzy&quot; area, this hotel offers everything you will need. The location is central to most of the lower mainland with travel time to downtown Vancouver about 20 minutes and 20 minutes or so to the burbs.  Clean hotel, friendly and helpful staff.  Don't hesitate on this hotel, you won't be dissapointed."
155174449,VCBCX1,"Coquitlam, Canada",2013-03-20,Vancouver X Inn,The staff were all very nice and helpful. The rates were reasonable. There is a park next door for our dogs. We paid $14 a day for valet service which was worth it. Only downside was the breakfast buffet which imho was terrible for $19. Otherwise great hotel next to the metrotown mall. Did not hear noise from any of the rooms.
180416481,VCBCX1,"Coquitlam, Canada",2013-10-09,Vancouver X Inn,"We held our 30 year school reunion at the XT. It was a great venue, and part of the reason for choosing the XT is that it was convenient to transit. The staff was friendly, and we as a group got a great room rate. The organizational staff went above and beyond for us, helping us plan and execute our Reunion theme."
577253761,VCBCX1,"Coquitlam, Canada",2018-05-01,Vancouver X Inn,"As always the front desk is very organized, had speedy check in and check out timeframes. The location is great and close to everything and love having Metrotown right beside the facility. I especially love Crystal Mall attached to the hotel which allows for quick shopping and a great food court."
367674650,VCBCX1,"Coquitlam, Canada",2016-04-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Fantastic front desk personnel, expedited check-in and bellhop service. The rooms are greatly appointed and the rooms have extremely comfortable beds. The location is extremely convenient to all types of restaurants and the large Metrotown mall close by within 1 block."
150786680,VCBCX1,"Coralville, Iowa",2013-01-27,Vancouver X Inn,"Loved that the hotel is just a short stroll from the Metrotown subway (which gets you to the airport as well as downtown Vancouver) and also appreciated that there are several restaurants within walking distance as well. Most of the staff is very courtesy, particularly those at the front desk. The rooms are large and many offer a beautiful view of skyscrapers and mountains. The breakfast buffet is perfectly acceptable but the latency shown by the breakfast waiter both mornings we dined was frustrating. Slow to bring us drinks and VERY slow to pick up our used/finished plates from the table. He needs to really get on the ball and be more responsive to the hotel's customers. If it wasn't for the less than stellar service offered at the restaurant I probably would have rated the property very good instead of average."
208231523,VCBCX1,"Coralville, Iowa",2014-05-31,Vancouver X Inn,"I have stayed at the XT Metrotown on two previous occasions and have enjoyed those stays.  I like the convenient location close to the skytrain that goes quickly to downtown Vancouver.  It is also a short walk to the large Metrotown shopping center.  Exit a side door and you are in Crystal Mall, an Asian mall with a food court.  Finally, the price is much more reasonable than a stay in downtown Vancouver,The Executive Lounge serves two hot items (steamed dumplings and spinach pies one night), plus a cheese tray and desserts.  There is also an honor bar with a delicious hard cider.  This time the hotel was overrun by high school students on a school trip.  It made for a noisy night and difficult to get an elevator - small problems that are out of the hotel's control."
407081559,VCBCX1,"Coralville, Iowa",2016-08-18,Vancouver X Inn,"This is our go-to hotel in the Vancouver area.  I can count on consistent good service and a good night sleep.  The Exec Lounge service is excellent - both at breakfast and during evening cocktail hours.  I also like the convenient location to the Metrotown Mall.  In addition, the hotel is connected to Crystal Mall, an Asian mall with restaurants, services, and a market place.  With the Skytrain, this hotel provides easy access to downtown Vancouver and the airport."
446100741,VCBCX1,Courtenay,2016-12-22,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed on the 11th floor. The staff here are friendly and helpful. Our room had a small fridge and coffee maker. The bed was comfortable and had nice linens.There is an Asian mall adjacent to the hotel with a food court featuring authentic Asian food. Metro town is across the street from the hotel. Tip - you can cut through the strip mall where Best Buy is to get to Metrotown rather than walking around.The outdoor pool and hot tub were closed due to it being winter. The gym is small but adequate with various cardio machines and some free weights. Tip - take earphones to plug into the separate media screens on each machine. There were towels and a water cooler in the fitness area.
246467028,VCBCX1,"Courtenay, Canada",2014-12-28,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff is efficient, polite and helpful.  The location is great with skytrains and shopping centres nearby.  The rooms are quiet and clean.  The bed is great if you like soft mattress and fluffy pillows.  The room is not as big as you expected from their website.  The breakfast is better from the menu than the buffet.  That's all I have to say so I am sorry not able to give you 200 characters reviews.  Thanks.  Your are welcome.  Nothing else to say.

298177134,VCBCX1,"Cowichan Bay, Canada",2015-08-11,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel was nice and the service was good, but the hotel seemed to be a bit outdated and in need of a renovation.  The swimming pool was very narrow but the small kids pool was a hit with the smaller kids.  The restaurant was very pleasant and the food was good."
512215599,VCBCX1,"Creston, Canada",2017-08-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Only able to stay one night but would have liked to have stayed longer. This hotel is within walking distance to Metrotown and the sky train and it has underground parking. There is a fee but it is reduced for XT honours members. The concierge and front desk staff are great. We have stayed at the holiday inn express which is closer to the mall and has breakfast but I much prefer the XT. The rooms are bigger and better designed. The windows are large with great city views. The beds are way comfier and most importantly there is silence in the room. I recommend paying more to stay here. There is also a great Asian mall just off the lobby. It is like a mini Chinatown with an Asian market and many stores. Also, we ordered pizza from room service. It was delicious and reasonably priced. We will definitely come back again when we can stay longer!"
434260930,VCBCX1,"Cumberland, Canada",2016-11-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Perfect spot to get a good night sleep while in the city for a 2 day course. Close to the skytrain, shopping and many restaurants. Very comfy bed, Clean bathroom.  Just ask them to turn up the hot tub before you go in!"
263836268,VCBCX1,"Dallas, Texas",2015-04-05,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice property and staff, however note this is several KM outside of the city center.  Upon check in, was given a diamond upgrade to an executive suite.  I had a killer view of downtown Vancouver from the 17th floor, amazing!  Room was comfortable and clean, and housekeeping did a great job.  The executive lounge was superb, great views, great spread of appetizers and nice breakfast variety.  Service in the lounge was second to none.  As far as location, this was a double edge sword.  The hotel is right next to two malls, one of which is full of Chinese markets and restaurants.  Several other good restaurants were also an easy walk away.  However, this hotel is a good distance from the center of downtown.  It is only about $3 to get downtown on the light rail, but it will take about 30 - 40 minutes total with the walk to the station and the ride.  Worth weighing the trade off.  Overall a great stay and I would recommend highly."
274413266,VCBCX1,"Dallas, Texas",2015-05-25,Vancouver X Inn,I have been staying at this hotel when in Vancouver for 14 years and am always pleased with my stay.  The level of customer service is superb and as someone who stays in hotels approx. 100 nights/year I know the difference.  I was staying on a mix of points and paid stay nights which has proven complicated at other hotels.  Not here.  I didn't have to do a thing. So kudos to a well trained staff.  Parking is free which is a rarity.  As I am XT Gold I was given the continental breakfast buffet which is upgradeable to anything off the menu or the hot breakfast buffet for only $4.00.  There are lots of restaurants within walking distance and downtown Vancouver is a quick Sky Train ride away.
186691227,VCBCX1,"Dallas, Texas",2013-12-03,Vancouver X Inn,I travel 30+ weeks a year throughout North America and this hotel in my favorite.  I am a XT Diamond Member and really feel that when I am here.  The upgraded one bedroom suite and the complimentary concierge lounge are second to none.  Jennifer who worked the lounge most evenings when I was there does a superb job.  She is very personable and friendly.  All of the hosts do a great job.  My only request would be a bit of variety in the morning hot dishes.  I stayed 10 days and it was always scrambled eggs and potatoes.From the first impression at the front desk to the entire day to day hotel experience this is a very customer focused hotel.
178823630,VCBCX1,"Dallas, Texas",2013-09-27,Vancouver X Inn,"This XT is a very plain XT, nothing fancy. If you are an elite Hhonors member be prepared to fight for your benefits, they don't like to offer the upgrades and benefits that come with the membership. That said the rooms are large and clean but very plain. Its just a 10 minute walk from the light rail station, so getting back and from downtown Vancouver is very easy. Will try and look for another XT property for our future visits."
390691403,VCBCX1,"Dallas, Texas",2016-07-09,Vancouver X Inn,I stay at this hotel whenever I am in the city as the location is near family and the convenience of Metrotown shops and movies and the Sky Train.  It is a full service XT property.  The staff is what makes this hotel very special to me.  The consistently go out of their way to provide superb customer service. It is spotless and very well maintained. I look forward to my next visit.
319808233,VCBCX1,"Dallas, Texas",2015-10-18,Vancouver X Inn,I stay at this hotel 2 or 3 times a year and every time I stay there I am impressed by the high level of customer service and the overall hotel experience.  The staff are extremely accommodating. The beds are so comfortable that I sleep wonderfully well there which is not my normal hotel experience.  Excellent locations with many shops and restaurants a short walk away.
228288950,VCBCX1,"Dallas, Texas",2014-09-11,Vancouver X Inn,Was great at the front desk with a friendly young lady with a great smile and very helpful.  She upgraded me because of status got the valet to park my car.  The hotel is clean and everyone seams happy with there position always asking to help in any way.
223760713,VCBCX1,"Dana Point, United States",2014-08-22,Vancouver X Inn,"Was treated extremely poorly and can only assume it was because I am American and not Canadian. I had 3 rooms booked under my name, because they were sold out, the hotel randomly decided to cancel two of the rooms which I booked for my clients.  They refused to provide any additional rooms and we all had to share.  Even after speaking to the XT Diamond desk who said they were at fault, and tried to reason with the hotel manager.  Nothing was done. It was horrible, especially if you consider I am a XT Diamond member. The hotel itself if okay, it's a basic XT that hasn't been updated for awhile.  It's in a very poor location as well."
231496731,VCBCX1,"Dawson Creek, Canada",2014-09-28,Vancouver X Inn,"Error with reservation not being made by the office was quickly and professionally handled by the staff.  Had me in a room in a near hassle free process.  Food in the restaurant was stellar, and the beer was cold and not over priced.  Parking was easy, and location was great for both business and for anyone wanting to see some sights or to do some shopping... Still not 200 Characters yet?  How much more do I need to write... OK I am going to just try to hit enter and see if I have written enough yet..."
605116068,VCBCX1,"Dawson Creek, Canada",2018-08-10,Vancouver X Inn,I utilize this hotel several times per year and have always enjoyed the experience.  The staff is very friendly and courteous.  The rooms are spacious and very clean and the beds are really comfortable.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone!
371346815,VCBCX1,"Dawson Creek, Canada",2016-05-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Great staff, thoroughly pleasant and great to deal with.  Extremely helpful and performed their jobs above and beyond.  Lousy &quot;complimentary&quot; internet though, once evening hit it slowed down to dial up speeds."
334253063,VCBCX1,"Delta, Canada",2015-12-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Corporate Christmas party moved here this year. . . Food was Absolutely GREAT!Usual quality for XT rooms, BUT. . . Only sheer curtains on the windows. . . The drapes are only for a &quot;Framing Appearance&quot; ... they won't draw across to block out the sun!  (What sun in Vancouver?)  Have to guess renovations are in the immediate future. . . four condo-towers under construction directly across the street at the front of the hotel. . . The underground parking is a disaster. . . I thought I was driving halfway home before I found the exit!"
190235492,VCBCX1,"Delta, Canada",2014-01-08,Vancouver X Inn,The staff are consistently efficient and friendly. The valet service is outstanding. Meals are prepared as ordered and fresh. The heating systems in the rooms are chronically noisy. I wish they had slippers and robes like other hotels at this level.
339850908,VCBCX1,"Delta, Canada",2016-01-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Our organization has used the Metrotown XT for our AGM's on several occasions. The hotel is centrally located, has all required amenities and the staff works hard to ensure the success of our events. We will be returning!"
168320408,VCBCX1,"Denver, CO",2013-07-20,Vancouver X Inn,"Friendly staff, clean rooms, usable gym.  Parking garage can be a bit tricky but has abundant parking and isn't overpriced.  A bit outside of town (30 mins to Vancouver downtown) but surrounded by grocery stores and restaurants.  More acceptable per-night price than downtown Vancouver accommodations."
388197291,VCBCX1,"Denver, Colorado",2016-07-01,Vancouver X Inn,"We booked a King room, but got an upgrade to the executive suite Floor (17) as part of a group booking.  The room included a very good brakfast in the lounge on the 18th floor, and a wonderful happy hour that included non-alcoholic drinks, sliders, veggie tray, and substantial paninis.  Great food and friendly staff.  Parking was $12 a day, but parking in this area is at a premium, so well worth it.  Highly recommended hotel near the skytrain and easy access roads."
211070777,VCBCX1,"Denver, Colorado",2014-06-19,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel is run superbly and has a friendly and professional staff! Next to the largest mall in Vancouver and the sky train.  Many restaurants and stores nearby.  Excellent spot to explore this great city w good room rates.  Rooms are excellent w great views of the city and harbor. Wonderful exec lounge on top floor.  Don't miss this gem.
501119017,VCBCX1,"Denver, United States",2017-07-11,Vancouver X Inn,"the Hotel has attractive rooms, but the service is simply not up to XT standards. I asked about breakfast and they acted like it was free and it was just a restaurant. I asked about coffee in the morning and they tried to sell me Starbucks when there was coffee in the lobby. I never felt special or cared for."
160418114,VCBCX1,"Detroit, Michigan",2013-05-11,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a good place to stay when in Vancouver, unless you can afford Downtown.  Really close to the skyrail where you can get to almost any attraction you want to visit.  We got a good price for the hotel.  I am convinced that the XT hotels have the greatest hotel staff so far.  The staff here was absolutely wonderful.  Look up &quot;Rommell&quot; he is awesome and extremely helpful, expecting nothing in return.  Our room was on the 12th floor - nice view.  The beds were too soft for me and my husband but our travel partners loved them."
152815655,VCBCX1,"Diamond Bar, California",2013-02-22,Vancouver X Inn,"The receptionist called me by my last name before I show my ID, probably because i was the last one to check in that day, i was surprised but happy, Location was great, in the same building of a busy shopping center.Breakfast was not bad, lots of choices.Room 422 somehow was very noisy because of some mechanical problems, they let me transfer to room 424 at 3am in the morning, they responded very fast after I called the front desk."
376269591,VCBCX1,"Doylestown, Pennsylvania",2016-05-24,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at this hotel for 7 days.I am a XT Hotel fan and this one was very good. The staff were excellent.Responsive and friendly.The breakfast is outstanding.The bar was very good.I would stay here again.  Metrotown is an attractive area, but a little far from downtown,Vancouver"
392587479,VCBCX1,"Draper, Utah",2016-07-14,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel itself is very good.  Rooms are terrific, bar and restaurant are fine and the staff is XT quality.  The only knock I had and its as much my fault as the hotel's is I had no idea it is so far out of town and not at all in Vancouver as the name would lead you to believe.  So, if you are looking to be somewhere in the center of Vancouver look elsewhere but if that is not an issue than this is an excellent place to stay."
196831323,VCBCX1,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",2014-03-10,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed here for 4 nights on a business trip. The hotel is clean, basic amenities, no toothbrush or other bathroom amenities, but the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet even though it was right beside the elevators. Breakfast buffet is very basic. A shopping mall is very close for any shopping you may need and the location is pretty good even to downtown."
548957563,VCBCX1,"Dubuque, Iowa",2017-12-23,Vancouver X Inn,"Arrived at 1am, was told that there was no free drinking water in lobby or room. Also had to pay for parking ($16 per day). Very confusing parking lot/signs.   Was told that check out time is 11am. Then when I actually checked out, they told me the check out time is 12pm. Ah!"
540455660,VCBCX1,"Duncan, Canada",2017-11-12,Vancouver X Inn,"I have stayed at the Metro Town XT quite a few times. Like the location even with the construction going on across the road. This hotel has always been clean, organized, accommodating, and focused on making my stay the best they can.  "
456616369,VCBCX1,"Duncan, Canada",2017-02-01,Vancouver X Inn,I have stayed at this XT a fair amount of time the staff are Friendly Place is clean Rooms are very well keep The Bar Staff remembered what I liked and accommodated what I needed with the food I was Nice
176166058,VCBCX1,Duxbury,2013-09-07,Vancouver X Inn,"The Hotel appearance is top notch and the Staff are friendly, helpfull and quick to make sure any concerns are looked after.  Prior to arrival our room was upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite courtesy of Anthony and Wendy and included a continental breakfast.  We were also able to change the continental breakfast to a buffet breakfast for a small fee  Our room was clean and comfortable and exceeded the value for the price paid on the nightly charges   This location is ideal for travelling around Metro-South-West Burnaby and borders on South Vancouver as well as other cities with easy connections by either Car / SkyTrain or walking distance to major shopping and rapid transit. to Downtown Vancouver, N.Burnaby-SFU, Richmond, N.Vancouver, New Westminster, Surrey, Coquitlam.  Recent changes and new construction developements in the hotel area are an inconvenience but in the next 2-6 years these projects and improvements will be a major world class upgrade for this area.."
573744932,VCBCX1,"Eagle, Idaho",2018-04-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Preferred location when working in Vancouver area, plenty going on yet quiet hotel. Shopping, restaurants and proximity to business makes this a win win. Staff is friendly (as are all in BC!) and courteous. "
248181024,VCBCX1,earth,2015-01-07,Vancouver X Inn,"I lucked out, put in an offer on a bidding site, and got XT Metrotown - I have stayed here before and enjoyed it. I wasn't disappointed.  Paid for access to executive lounge, as the upper rooms were sold out.  Not exactly free, but the perks and convenience are worth it, as I am a light evening eater.  Pay parking, that's what you get for being in a densely populated area, but I always had a spot.  Room was on the 7th floor (I think), faced N-NW, was quite large,  Staff were nice, wifi is finally free, not the fastest, but it works.  Many restaurants and shops, including Metrotown, just a short walk away.  Skytrain station a few blocks away to go downtown.   This is a comfortable premium feeling place in a good location, would stay again."
388729646,VCBCX1,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",2016-07-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Firstly I want to be really clear - the hotel itself was fine! The room was big and clean, reception was really lovely. The breakfast was also stand out! Just be careful if you are looking for a great location - it was a bit of a walk to the train (especially with bags) and personally I found it to be a bit out of the way. There were some good places to eat - all within a 15/20 minute walk but not a lot of alternatives directly beside the hotel. Depends what you are looking for really!"
339786080,VCBCX1,Edmonton,2016-01-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Hotel was clean, staff excellent.  Its worth the price to get a executive level room for the upgrades and ammenities it comes with.  Hotel is within walking distance of skytrain and attached to Crystal mall where you can get great food. Right near metrotown mall too."
500357164,VCBCX1,Edmonton ,2017-07-10,Vancouver X Inn,I stayed at the XT Metrotown for a few nights and the hotel was by far one of the best hotels I have stayed at. Friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is located at walking distance from the mall but not very close to the airport.
198994444,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Alberta, Canada",2014-03-27,Vancouver X Inn,"The Vancouver XT Metrotown in Burnaby is situated in an ideal location - close to the Metrotown Shopping Centre and Sky Train (2 blocks away).  The staff is very accommodating, the food excellent and the Sunday Brunch is beyond expectations.  I would give this hotel 4 stars."
174360333,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2013-08-27,Vancouver X Inn,"I don't feel like this hotel is meant for families. Or extended stays. There is a pool, in a cool rooftop location, but it's definitely not meant for children. The room lacked a fridge and microwave which was kind of inconvenient. The room itself was nice. I loved the floor to ceiling windows. The bathroom however looked like it was missed during the cleaning. There was hair under the sink (not just a strand that could have come from the Housekeeper her/himself) and hair hanging from the fixtures in the shower. It was pretty gross and led us to doubt the cleanliness of the rest of the room.The staff was wonderful. Very helpful, friendly, and informative.The location of this hotel is pretty good. Right next to a big mall, and close to an assortment of restaurants."
249718968,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2015-01-17,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is located at the junction of Kingsway and Boundary RdIt is next to the Crystal Mall, where there is a walkway on the second floor where there are lots of grocery stores and food court with excellent foods e.g. Malaysian satay, Hainan chicken rice etcLots of Asian travellers in and out of the hotel on a daily basisEasy to commute to Metrotown,and there is a park next to the hotelThe hotel building is somewhat old,and the decoration is averageHowever the rooms and the bedsheets are cleanHotel front desk staffs are efficient,especially the bellcaptain is  always on alert for hotel guest who get off from the taxis"
156903201,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2013-04-07,Vancouver X Inn,"I travelled with a group of 30+ people and all of our group were very happy with the hotel. We were all taken care of and there were no complaints. The rooms were well equipped; our groups rooms were booked close together; the concierge was always helpful. Bellhops assisted with the usual, the manager came and greeted me, as I was managing the group, and made the experience a personal one. The bar staff accommodated our crew and were very conscientious. The level of care given is very hard to find most places these days. Thank You, XT:)"
246533043,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2014-12-30,Vancouver X Inn,Check in was fast. I first had a hard time finding my room. When I got off the elevator there was no sign where to go. Later I found that sign was beside the elevator I got off from. The sign should be on the opposit site! Room was clean with a contemporary design. The bed was somewhat uncomfortable and my body was aking in the morning. My real peeve was the washroom. It's very small. The sink is beside the toilet and I have to squeeze myself in a little space between the sink and the toilet. I will upload a picture of this strage setup.
364038988,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2016-04-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Good value if booked in advance.  Location is great - average cab fare from YVR is usually $30.  The sound isolation between rooms is good, elevators are slow.  Highspeed internet is not so great... usual download speed in evening is 1-5mbps.  Place is clean.  Location is good.  There is lots of choice in the area so rates are usually competitive.  If eating breakfast at the hotel is something you plan on doing try to get the breakfast voucher when you book the reservation otherwise it will be pricey but not unreasonable."
308544979,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2015-09-09,Vancouver X Inn,Located in burnaby.  30 min drive to airport or downtown vancouver.   Tons of shops and food around.   All staff were great.  Rooms were clean but very small.  Large windows in room with only sheer curtains.  So once the sun rises so do you.  Pillows and beds not the most comfortable in my opinion.  The lounge at the hotel is great.  The happy hour food was delicious and so were the drinks.  Definitely the better hotel choice in burnaby but compared to other areas of vancouver it is average.  
420857497,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2016-09-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Since I travel quite a bit I always appreciate a room where the heating and cooling system works properly, easily and quietly. The system in our room was all of that.We were on the 10th floor away from the elevators (3) and the room was nice and quiet.We needed non-feather pillows and house keeping took care of us very quickly.The restaurant on the third floor offered a buffet as well as a full menu breakfast.The food was good but the service was a little slow and seemed understaffed."
474458977,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2017-04-10,Vancouver X Inn,"I had never been out to BC, so it was wonderful to come into a warm welcome in the lobby that really set the tone of the entire stay. The staff were so friendly and helpful that I felt right at home. I didn't have to ask for anything because the staff were one step ahead of my needs, which made it really nice when I ducked into my room to decompress between conference events. I would highly recommend staying with them and look forward to my next visit."
158054535,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2013-04-17,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here for a weekend with 2 couples to attend a wedding in Vancouver and a reception in New Westminster.  The location was nice and central to both locations.  Typical XT Hotel, clean and quiet and with comfortable beds.  Walking distance to shopping, sky train and local park.  Note we did have to pay $9 a night for self park, but it was still good value when combined with the rate we got on Hotwire.  Overall we were happy with this pick."
254369363,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2015-02-15,Vancouver X Inn,"The XT in Burnaby across from Metrotown was a great hotel to stay at.  The beds were comfortable and cozy and the rooms were nice and big.  I had a nice desk for my computer, and fairly reliable free wifi internet.The location is really good if you want to be close to everything you need.  It's right across from the Metropolis mall.I would definitely stay there again when in Burnaby."
170170466,VCBCX1,"edmonton, Canada",2013-04-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Overall very good; would stay again. Rooms were very nice and clean. Disappointed that we had to not only pay for internet access but for each device which is outrageous at a hotel of this quality. Parkade is dreadful, very congested, would have been a appreciated gesture to have a reduction on parking fee. Close to shopping. Will be nice when construction around the hotel in finished."
469941856,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2017-03-24,Vancouver X Inn,"Room was quiet and comfortable, and all staff I met were friendly and professional. The valet parking is a great alternative to the cramped, busy underground parking area. I didn't try the onsite restaurant, there are several nearby within walking distance that look good. I would stay at this location again when I'm in the Vancouver area for business. "
238688159,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2014-11-07,Vancouver X Inn,Enjoyed our 4 night stay in May 2014. We rented a car and were able to get anywhere around Van in 20-30mins. The sky train is close by. The room was very nice and staff were pleasant. Check in was easy. The pool is quite small but nice to have. Room was nice and clean! Lots of places shop and get food nearby. We will return for sure!
230419998,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2014-09-22,Vancouver X Inn,"in town for business - stayed here last trip to the area.  This time had a lower level room that seemed to have not been updated - room was a little dated - but clean, tidy, and well furnished.  Disappointed that for the price of the room, I still need to pay additional charge for internet.  Had room service and the food was great."
171136299,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2013-08-06,Vancouver X Inn,Best value - excellent staff  Clean room with a terrific view.  Looking forward to my next trip to Vancouver.  Worth the 15 minute drive to downtown for a better hotel at a lower price.  The top floor serves breakfast for Diamond members and is better than the regular breakfast - and comes with a great view od the area.
221709035,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2014-08-13,Vancouver X Inn,"I highly recommend The XT in Burnaby BC.  The clean white crisp bedding was superb, the matress exremely comfortable.  The lighting was bright, the bathroom beautiful, clean, clean, clean.  Absolutely squeeky clean.  The staff couldn't have been more accommodating.  We were very happy there."
556153178,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2018-01-24,Vancouver X Inn,"We enjoyed the location close to BCIT, public transportation, numerous restaurants and stores.  It was extremely easy to use the Skytrain to get downtown!  The only drawback is the 40 dollar cab ride from the airport.  The skytrain would work but takes a lot of time."
194083608,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2014-02-14,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice place, Nice food, good gym, surrounded by a lot of good restaurants if you want to go out and enjoy a wet walk!!

334521483,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2015-12-22,Vancouver X Inn,"parking is kind of odd, make sure you park in the correct area. Check in was quick and easy. I arrived early but had no problem getting into my room. I got a room on the 16th floor. The room was exceptionally clean and bright. Everything was in perfect order."
345732859,VCBCX1,"edmonton, Canada",2016-02-07,Vancouver X Inn,"There are a lot of things has to be resolved,in terms of smell of the floor and room ,parking space and  internet connection. The location is good but the room charge does not reflect what you are getting it for. Staff generally does not care for customers."
557582450,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2018-01-31,Vancouver X Inn,"I stay at this hotel specifically for the location and service.  Rooms are clean and the staff is great.  Check this hotel out...close to everything...shopping and restaurants. The hotel restaurant is great, room service is great too!"
460943158,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2017-02-18,Vancouver X Inn,Fast and friendly check in upon arrival. Room was very clean and fresh. Had breakfast a la carte in the restaurant. Food and service as to be expected at a XT property. Pleasant experience when checking out. 
265185005,VCBCX1,"Edmonton, Canada",2015-04-11,Vancouver X Inn,"Clean, friendly staff, close to shopping...horrible parking lot. Could have more amenities such as free coffee in lobby, fruit etc. Could also have a gift shop, we couldn't find one. All in all a descent hotel."
293974917,VCBCX1,"El Paso, Texas, United States",2015-07-29,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is very well located in the City of Vancouver, a short distance from the City Sky Train, that takes you directly to the Town's main atractions. The XT Hotel has lot's of amenities and the food is very good for breakfast, lunch and diner."
622460482,VCBCX1,"Elizabeth, New Jersey",2018-10-05,Vancouver X Inn,"This was my first business trip in Vancouver and tons of hotels were sold out. But this XT was a solid option. It's on the small side but the rooms were more than enough for me. It's a two block walk from the Metrotown Skytrain station, which is super convenient. It's about half hour from the airport. There are plenty of shops and small malls within a block or two. I'd stay here again. "
202983282,VCBCX1,"Ellicott City, Maryland",2014-04-27,Vancouver X Inn,"We spent 6 nights at the hotel and our room was clean and quiet.  The staff was good and I received a thank you note from the housekeeper for our tip.  The restaurant staff was pleasant, but the food was fair.  The parking garage is extremely dangerous when trying to exit the garage during rush hour."
486968326,VCBCX1,"Epsom, United Kingdom",2017-05-23,Vancouver X Inn,"Metro town XT was a little too far out of downtown Vancouver for visitors, although the sky train was a couple of blocks away. The room was a little tired but comfortable, especially the bed. Bathroom was in need of tidying up, especially the grouting. The shower head needs changing as it sprayed water all  over the floor even with the curtain tucked in.The restaurant was satisfactory and the staff were very friendly. Continental breakfast had a poor selection and probably needs expanding. There are very few restaurants around this hotel, other than Asian cuisine.Decided to get another hotel on our return from a cruise closer to downtown."
175843911,VCBCX1,"Everett, United States",2013-09-04,Vancouver X Inn,"The XT chain is exceptional.  Stayed there in Japan for a long stay.  Vancouver was a good experience, except for loudness of the air conditioning system.  Also, if you want a refrigerator or microwave, you have to request them."
593025169,VCBCX1,"Everett, Washington",2018-07-04,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at the Vancouver XT mid- June 2018.

I highly recommend this Property  John and Corinne "
172461238,VCBCX1,"Fairfax, United States",2013-08-15,Vancouver X Inn,"Recommend this strongly without any reservations.  Hotel staff was quite helpful.  Booked this hotel using my XT Honors points and they double upgraded us to a suite without our prior knowledge, which was very nice.  Hotel is ideally situated to Metrotown mall and sky train.  Took a ride on the skytrain saw downtown and were back bed time."
356704459,VCBCX1,"Fairfield California, United States",2016-03-18,Vancouver X Inn,We stay here while visiting family in Burnaby.  We have tried several other hotels and they all come up short in one or more respects. We love the oriental food available in Food Court in the attached Crystal Mall.
600589291,VCBCX1,"Fairfield, Connecticut",2018-07-28,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice hotel in Burnaby which is a 15 minute skytrain ride from the Vancouver waterfront(station just down the street from hotel). Very clean, up to date rooms with a very helpful staff. A good option if you dont want to pay high price of staying downtown!"
502653444,VCBCX1,"Falls Church, VA",2017-07-16,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff of the hotel is excellent - friendly, focused and professional. One of the best run hotels we have stayed at. Staff goes out of its way to make you feel welcome and appreciated. Staying here gives easy access to a quality hotel without the downtown prices. Access to the city is easy."
474561570,VCBCX1,"Fareham, United Kingdom",2017-04-11,Vancouver X Inn,"Good quality XT in location near Sky Train and large Metro mall. Not good for walking to touristy parts of Vancouver - but easily accessible through public transport. Good size, comfortable room with clean and good size bathroom with shower-in-bath. All in good state of repair and functioning. small gym with 2 runners, 1 cross-trainer and rower and a few free weights. Didn't use the pool. Good breakfast and bar/evening food."
397301084,VCBCX1,"Fauquier, Canada",2016-07-26,Vancouver X Inn,Don't let the location scare you. If you ride the sky train its only twenty minutes away from downtown and it's a lovely way to see the city without fighting traffic. The sky train drops you off at metro town which is great if you haven't finished shopping. It's a two minute walk to the hotel. If you are driving it's the perfect location to drive in and out to the hwy.  Rooms were mordern and  super clean .  Unfortunately  we had to cut our vacation short . Both my husband and Igot a killer colds and when I went to the front desk to  cancel the rest of days they couldn't have been more helpful. They made all the calls I  couldn't do myself  by getting a refund from Expedia .  It was truly a team effort by all  staff.  It remind me of the old days of hotel service.I'm making this hotel my Vancouver hotel . 
371613910,VCBCX1,"Fayetteville, Arkansas",2016-05-09,Vancouver X Inn,"What a nice place! Folks are friendly, accomodating and service is quick and efficient. Only here one night but the restaurant/bar staff was very friendly and offered thoughts about the menu. Front desk had a luggage cart  us within minutes of calling--yes, it WAS 5:30 AM! I would definitely recommend this place to all our friends and family"
410732809,VCBCX1,"Fernie, Canada",2016-08-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Booked for a couple of days in August. Should have read more of the Tripadvisor reviews. My overall summary is that this location is not up to XT standards. Very, very expensive breakfast ( yes I know I am in Vancouver ), slow check-in and situated 1.5 rooms from noisy ice machine. Check-out was efficient."
464180071,VCBCX1,"Fernie, Canada",2017-03-02,Vancouver X Inn,Very clean and quiet. Located beside Metrotown mall it is close to many excellent restaurants and services. Sky train is close so you can travel from the airport without the expense of a taxi. Staff is very nice and helpful.
195742333,VCBCX1,"Fishers, United States",2014-02-28,Vancouver X Inn,"A great place to stay while on business.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Close to many dining/bar options.  Wireless internet service is not great throughout the building, but overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to metro Vancouver."
207409295,VCBCX1,"Florianopolis, SC",2014-05-27,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice hotel, in Burnaby. I got a suite and the room is great and the service is excelent.The main drawback is the internet connection, that you pay for it and get less than a dial in connection. People at the hotel are very kind and the room is very spacious and clean.They should consider in improving the very very slow connection (56 kbits/sec )"
227525180,VCBCX1,Florida,2014-09-07,Vancouver X Inn,"My family and I stayed 3 nights at this hotel. The location was great. We did not have a rental car but we were able to get everyplace we needed on the SkyTrain (a couple of blocks away). The concierge was always absent, but the front desk manager was extremely helpful. I would stay again and would recommend the hotel to my friends."
167228847,VCBCX1,"Fort Collins, Colorado",2013-07-11,Vancouver X Inn,"Spent 3 nights in King room on high floor with access to Executive Lounge.This hotel is not your standard XT.  The walls, carpets, furnishings are most like the more budget friendly Hampton Inn.   You are paying for a XT and getting substandard rooms. The hotel is attached to a Chinese mall/office space that is old/shabby with an interesting food court.Executive Lounge is tiny and cramped but with views of downtown Vancouver in the distance.  Breakfast did include hot food items.Hotel gym is tiny and the equipment is substandard--like the rooms.Starbucks is one block away"
503711331,VCBCX1,"Fort Frances, Canada",2017-07-19,Vancouver X Inn,"My daughter and I tagged along on a business trip for my husband. As he was staying through a corporate account, they were very friendly at front desk, early check in, wifi password, requested views, etc. The rooms were dated, as said, and the pool area isn't meant for a lot of guests. It does have a kiddie pool, which my daughter loved. The pool was in an inconvenient spot. The host/hostess at breakfast were fantastic! One gentleman would check in with my daughter every morning with what adventures she was on. Convenient location, food was good, housekeeping was timely."
483064880,VCBCX1,"Fort Langley, Canada",2017-05-09,Vancouver X Inn,"Centrally located, 20 minutes from Downtown Vancouver (depending on traffic). Nearby are 3 large shopping malls nearby...Metropolous, Crystal and Station Square, lots and a wide variety of restaurant styles nearby.Way too many u used valet parking spot located on P1 level, only about 1/2 dozen for self parking. P2 has another 20 or so and if full, you have to park in the office building/ Crystal Mall P2 and P3 level. Valet spots need to be changed to XT Honors card holders in my opinion.Pets okay but $49 per stay.$12 charge for parking. Skytrain nearby."
388685783,VCBCX1,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",2016-07-03,Vancouver X Inn,"We Stayed 3 days, including over Canada Day, so hotel was busy. The hotel is small but efficient and rooms themselves are large enough. Very clean, great location, exceptional service. Staff friendly and helpful.  Bed was comfy. Location is close to shopping and eating and transportation. Couldn't have been happier!"
184844293,VCBCX1,"Fort Pierce, United States",2013-11-15,Vancouver X Inn,Stay often and really enjoy the staff.  I stay there over 50 days per year for three years. I use the executive lounge on each visit. The rooms are well maintained. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.
627304183,VCBCX1,"Fort Smith, Arkansas",2018-10-22,Vancouver X Inn,Due to issues with the airlines I arrived at the hotel a day late with no luggage.  Unfortunately because I forgot to call my reservation was canceled and the hotel was sold out for that night.  The manager went above and beyond by making arrangements for me to stay at another hotel close by for 1 night and had my luggage shipped over to the other hotel once it arrived.  When I did make it back to the hotel they put me in a beautiful corner room on the 15th floor with an amazing view of the city.  
473190993,VCBCX1,"Fort St. John, Canada",2017-04-06,Vancouver X Inn,I've stayed here twice now for work and I was treated like the queen! I called from the sky train station late at night and asked for directions from there and the gentleman who answered the phone offered to come meet me at the station to help with my bags. I thanked him but declined as I only had an overnight shoulder bag and started walking. About 2 minutes later I hear jingling coming towards me and say the man jogging towards me stating he wanted to ensure I arrived safely as it was night and 'Vancouver'. I was blown away! Such a nice gesture. The room was also beautiful as always and the bed super comfy. 
169476274,VCBCX1,"Frankfurt, Germany",2013-07-28,Vancouver X Inn,"Probably I need to get used with the fact that the XT hotels in North America are way worst than the XT hotels in Europe, but I ran away from the XT after only one day. In Vancouver for a business trip, I chose the XT because I'm a diamond member and I had very good experiences in Europe. Here, however, the experience was not so nice; despite having received an upgrade, the room was quite ordinary, and the executive lounge decisively small. The biggest problem, however, was the location: despite being presented as a Vancouver XT it took me about 50 minutes to reach downtown (Burrard Street), and this was what pushed me eventually to switch to a more central hotel. The service was excellent both at the front-desk and at the lounge, as always had been the case with the XT"
376000758,VCBCX1,"Freeland, WA",2016-05-23,Vancouver X Inn,"A lovely hotel.  Clean and people were nice. The location was away from downtown BC, but offered many nice restaurants and the giant mall.  A bit urban for us, but it has great access to the Sky Train that we used twice during our stay."
418258258,VCBCX1,"Gainesville, Florida",2016-09-13,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed in the Metro town XT since it was so close to sky train. It is 5 minute walk to metro. The building is older but clean. The service was amazing. We had drinks at the bar 2 nights and the bar tenders have great tips where to visit and where to stay away. The buffet breakfast was awesome and had a great variety. The hotel is in the middle of an Asian market, so it was great to visit the fruit, meat, and bread stands. We had a taxi take us to the airport and we waited a few seconds for one. Was a flat fee for trip. Was a great stay. "
290983598,VCBCX1,Gardabaer,2015-07-21,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is really a nice XT, with nice and helpful staff. We opted for an executive floor package which included access to a very good executive lounge with good breakfast and late afternoon light food, wi-fi and parking. The room was very nice, clean and with everything you need. The location is outside the centre but you have a relatively easy access to the centre with the metro which stops ca 5-7 min walk from the hotel. We did not find many restaurants close to the hotel, need a car. The mall next door is large but not an upscale mall so If you want to dine and shop downtown every day you should stay downtown but we had other things to do aswell so this was a good choice. I would not hesitate to stay again in this hotel"
160037885,VCBCX1,"Gatineau, Canada",2013-05-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Second time in this hotel, enjoying it very much close to major shopping and multiple restaurants.Staff very friendly, from valet to executive lounge.I would recommended this hotel any day for business or pleasure travel.Keep up the good work."

161284039,VCBCX1,"Georgetown, Texas",2013-05-20,Vancouver X Inn,"The Hotel was good and substantial upgrade to Suite.  Service in lounge was Ok, but spoke limited English and did know drinks as he was a sub for real bartender.  There was no outside entertainment or sites so we moved the next day closer to Cruise and downtown Vancouver."
532238186,VCBCX1,"Gibsons, Canada",2017-10-11,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel has group bookings down pat. From start to finish they are amazing. They even had a movie night for kids in the evening Saturday. Price is fantastic for a group and service is great. Upon arrival check in was extremely quick and efficient. I would definitely stay here again
427260163,VCBCX1,"Gibsons, Canada",2016-10-11,Vancouver X Inn,"We loved coming to this hotel from out of town, it was a clean, wonderful escape for our family. The rooms were clean, quiet and comfortable for the whole family. The food was fantastic and served by great relaxed staff that made all our requests easily come true."

441824616,VCBCX1,"Gladstone, Oregon",2016-12-03,Vancouver X Inn,"My husband, teenage daughter and I stayed 3 nights here in late November. Loved the room on the Executive Floor - plenty of space for the 3 of us. Very quiet - never heard anyone! The room was clean. The beds were a bit soft, but we all slept very well. The free breakfast and evening appetizers were wonderful each night. Great location near the light rail line. If we find ourselves in that area again, I won't hesitate to book here again!"
422461684,VCBCX1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",2016-09-26,Vancouver X Inn,"We.were 2couples from Scotland heading on cruise to Alaska,we spent 3night before and 1 night after our cruise at this hotel,We found the whole experience excellent from the moment we arrived ,the staff from porters to reception ,resturant and bar staff were so professional and friendly .The location is only a short walk to the Sky train taking you downtown in  20minutes and for the shoppers the Metropolis shopping mall is across the road,there is also a nice outdoor swimming and jacuzzi pool wish was ideal considering the lovely weather we had,On the day we were leaving we spent a few hours at the pool enjoying a few beers served by and elderly gent  with grey hair called Steve his attention was exceptional and we share good chat and fun with him ,keep up the good  Tom Martin"
203007717,VCBCX1,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",2014-04-27,Vancouver X Inn,"Just back from a weekend in Vancouver, fabulous hotel very warm welcome. Staff could not do enough for me.

All the staff are so friendly and the food is fantastic... always love coming to the XT for work. 
520856929,VCBCX1,"Glastonbury, United Kingdom",2017-09-03,Vancouver X Inn,"The warmest greeting and comforts of home. The staff are amazing and the food is excellent. It is close to everything in Burnaby that you need , train, shopping, cinema, great restaurants. I always enjoy seeing the same staff welcome me to the hotel"
524504627,VCBCX1,"Glen Carbon, Illinois, United States",2017-09-14,Vancouver X Inn,"As a Diamond, I see a lot of XTs.  This hotel was well managed, and every interaction was excellent.  Leonora at the front desk was about as helpful as I have experienced in a long time.  The breakfast was excellent for a buffet.  Location wise, it is a quick walk to the Skytrain, and a 20 minute ride to the waterfront in Vancouver.  Lots of restaurants nearby (Dinesty Dumpling is a MUST) and easy parking under the hotel.  Rooms have views if you want to pay the upgrade.  For Diamonds, there is a lounge.  Nothing special, typical XT lounge.  If you want to avoid the higher costs in downtown Vancouver, this is a great alternative."
384856409,VCBCX1,"Glenview, United States",2016-06-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed there for 3 nights.  Rooms are roomy and comfortable.  Had a pretty good view from the room (mountain view). Lobby is plain looking and staff are ok but not too engaging.  Parking is underground and connect to the hotel, $12 a day and can be in-and-out all day.  Will stay there again if the price is competitive (we paid $200 a night)."
288368205,VCBCX1,"Gold Coast, Australia",2015-07-12,Vancouver X Inn,"Mid July stay, on a very warm day. The room was comfortable, AC worked fine. Nice modern bathroom and good sleep quality. Close to metrotown shopping center. Convenient underground parking ($11 plus tax), and free WIFI, at least on this occasion. Would recommend. Warning to foreign travellers though: advertised rates are exclusive of taxes which added $30 to the base room rate of $209."
393185792,VCBCX1,"Gold Coast, Australia",2016-07-16,Vancouver X Inn,"The rooms and bathrooms were very clean. The service was very good in general. I used the pool, which was very nice.staff was very professional and friendly.We got a free parking.the room was very spacious."
616259615,VCBCX1,"Golden, Canada",2018-09-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice hotel, excellent fitness center, Underground parking is a gong show, shared with public parking making it super busy and very very crowded. Can't turn the corner and stay in your own lane. I assume there are alot of minor accidents due to the small space. Room was very nice, free upgrade to a suite was appreciated too. Would return."
412517237,VCBCX1,"Goldsboro, North Carolina",2016-08-29,Vancouver X Inn,"If you are visiting downtown Vancouver, this hotel offers simple but good XT quality at a better-than-downtown price. It is just two blocks from the Sky Train station and has some shopping nearby. The staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and comfortable."
551004148,VCBCX1,"Grand Haven, Michigan",2018-01-02,Vancouver X Inn,"I really appreciated the main desks Attendant's advice that I should shop online for the best price at a XT, then call XT directly and ask them to price match!!!! That way I get the best price, and receive my XTHHonors too!!"
354205946,VCBCX1,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",2016-03-09,Vancouver X Inn,"I got yelled at for grabbing a carrot in the Honors lounge before the food was fully set. It was 10 minutes or more after the hour so I didn't understand it was still a work in progress, I guess she was mad she was running late. Anyway I just assumed it was light fare and got admonished.  You pay more for a glass of wine or beer in the honors lounge than in the bars in sourrounding aarea so the only thing it really offered was a comfortable environment, well used to anyway."
642277041,VCBCX1,"Granger, Indiana",2018-12-29,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a very well located hotel across from a large shopping mall and at a major street (Kingsway) with many food choices. The hotel is less than half an hour from the airport. It is in Burnaby and is centralized to have easy access to downtown Vancouver and surrounding areas of interest. The rooms are spacious suites and comfortable. The Opal Lounge on the 18th floor is a great relaxing space with a great view however it is quiet small for a large group. Overall, a very nice hotel but despite being located in Burnaby, it still has downtown Vancouver price.  "
453510473,VCBCX1,"Granite Bay, California",2017-01-19,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is Clean and close to restaurants and shopping. I came in at night. We were hungry and there's a bunch of Asian food around the area that were open late at night. Best buy across the street and I think the hotel was attached to a shopping place. I didn't really check it out, but I saw it on the way out the next day."
483301851,VCBCX1,"Granite Shoals, Texas",2017-05-10,Vancouver X Inn,Very nice updated hotel.  Good location. There are lots of restaurants close by.  The staff was very helpful and recommended our favorite place we ate in Vancouver.  We would stay here again.  Comfortable rooms and good mattresses.
225108289,VCBCX1,"Grapevine, Texas",2014-08-28,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is located in Burnaby, but only a 20 minute ride to downtown via the SkyTrain.  There are shops nearby (Metrotown Mall) with large Movie Theatre, and plenty of restaurant options.  Also nearby is the Crystal Mall, an Asian market with food stands.    Good value for the Vancouver area."
161697878,VCBCX1,"Grapevine, United States",2013-05-22,Vancouver X Inn,I was very pleased with the hotel and it's staff. Everyone was very accommodating and pleasant. Great service and good atmosphere. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Ever time I had a question it was answered quickly and very well.
396273904,VCBCX1,"Gray Court, South Carolina",2016-07-24,Vancouver X Inn,"While the physical property could use some updating the location and the staff (Stephanie, Leah, and Raj in particular) are great. They all bent over backwards to help us in every way from check in to helping us get around. So the negatives about the property are a small executive lounge used for the complimentary breakfast for diamond members. It is WAY undersized. The hotel could really be improved by remodeling this area.  Another change that should be made is to improve the access to the pool area. One has to traipse through the exercise room and then ascend a set of stairs. Otherwise the hotel is well kept, located close to the SkyTrain and the Metrotown mall (though the access is a bit hampered currently due to the construction nearby).  "
546225466,VCBCX1,Great White North,2017-12-09,Vancouver X Inn,"Staff encountered at check in were prompt and courteous. Hotel is well situated in terms of access to the Skytrain station and shopping.

497230328,VCBCX1,"Guelph, Canada",2017-06-29,Vancouver X Inn,"Been a while since I stayed at the Metrotown XT, thought I'd go back and see how it was. Staff were amazing, very friendly and helpful. Room was excellent; Wi-Fi was very good. Tried the room service pizza one night, very good pizza! Work out room was good. This is a very well situated hotel; we ate at some very good restaurants, all within walking distance. I will definitely be back to this one."
270343144,VCBCX1,"Guelph, Canada",2015-05-06,Vancouver X Inn,"Having heard of the Vancouver Metrotown XT, but never stayed, I was looking forward to this trip. This is a great XT.

403942955,VCBCX1,"Guelph, Canada",2016-08-10,Vancouver X Inn,Very nice hotel - we really liked it. Close enough to drive to Vancouver and other areas but also had a huge Metroland Mall within walking distance. Hotel itself was excellent and staff were fantastic.

Hotel is clean, staff is friendly and location is only a 5-10 minute walk to the HUGE Metropolis mall and several eating places. Room was clean, wifi worked perfectly. Only downside is it is a bit of a drive to downtown Vancouver."
543503433,VCBCX1,"Hamilton, Canada",2017-11-26,Vancouver X Inn,"The accommodation was great in all respects except that the Wi-Fi service was terrible. Slow as molasses. Had to hot-spot my phone to do business. Would rate it at excellent if the Wi-Fi was fixed, convenient location near the SkyTrain. It will be even better when the construction is done across the street and there is easier connection to the mall."
508045025,VCBCX1,"Hamilton, Canada",2017-08-02,Vancouver X Inn,"We visited Vancouver this summer, and decided to stay at the XT in Burnaby for 9 nights.

165275847,VCBCX1,"Hanson, Massachusetts",2013-06-25,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at the XT in Burnaby, just outside of Vancouver.  It's about 30 minutes from the international airport and closer to it than the city proper is.  Public transportation was easily available and the hotel is attached to a small mall.  There is a larger one right down the street.  Multiple restaurants are within walking distance and the hotel restaurant was outstanding for both breakfast and dinner.  We did rent a car as we wanted to see as much of the area as we could in our four day stop.  Every staff member in every department that we encountered was outstanding.  Helpful, speedy, courteous, pleasant, friendly.....  Would definitely stay here again."

614809909,VCBCX1,"Henderson, Nevada",2018-09-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Being attached to the Crystal Mall and across the street from the Metrotown Mall and only one block away from the Skytrain....how could this get any better? This XT is in the middle of everything with more choices to eat in the immediate vicinity than you can shake a stick at. Located approximately 20 minutes away from downtown Vancouver, but easily accessible via the metro or buses which are within a 5-minute walk away.The 18-story hotel is a delight, with excellent customer service from the well-trained staff. I spent 6 nights while in town for work and thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  Spotlessly clean rooms, with strong signal Wifi, great air conditioning and well-appointed bathrooms. The small Executive Lounge on the 18th floor has a good buffet breakfast 6 to 9am and evening hors d'oeuvres available from 5 to 9pm daily."
390717220,VCBCX1,"Henderson, Nevada",2016-07-09,Vancouver X Inn,"We very much enjoyed our stay here. We made use of the 18th floor lounge and although it is small, the food was very good and the staff were outstanding. Ditto the staff at the front desk, who were responsive, friendly, and knowledgeable. The hotel is convenient for transit to downtown, and local drugstores and shops are handy. Two small drawbacks made this a 4 and not 5 star review: the bathroom in our suite was cramped (yet the bedroom on the other side of the wall had large extra empty space), and it was tricky to get your key into the elevator slot to select your floor. Overall we recommend this hotel. "
428013675,VCBCX1,"Henderson, Nevada",2016-10-14,Vancouver X Inn,"We are members of the Marriott rewards programs and reserved a room at an excellent rate with extras. We received 3 free drinks each in the evening a complimentary breakfast, as well as paid taxi to the cruise port in the morning. Additionally, we were upgraded to a suite. The room was spacious and quiet with a very nice view of Vancouver. Modern conveniences with wireless and USB ports. The staff were outstanding: friendly and helpful. Breakfast was not buffet, but sit down and be served an above average quality of food. We'd definitely stay here again."
169228089,VCBCX1,"Highland, Maryland",2013-07-26,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is a good 20 to 30 min on the Skytrain to downtown Vancouver. However, the hotel is very nice.  I am a HH Diamond member and we were upgraded to a junior suite. Excecutive lounge is small but breakfast is more than adequate. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The adjacent mall next door is to be missed, nothing special, overtaken by Asian small businesses and catering to the large Chinese local community. The Metrotown mall across the street is much nicer."
537204420,VCBCX1,"Hillsboro, Oregon",2017-10-30,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel was great! I found the room to be perfectly sized. The guest service was great, she put us in a corner room with a beautiful view of the water. The room was very accessible for someone with an amputation. Bonus the bathtub was super deep and spa style. "
550554492,VCBCX1,"HK, Hong Kong",2017-12-31,Vancouver X Inn,"Shower tap has no hot water from time to time.   I complained twice, all i got was waived two nights of guests parking.  Anyway, they have great staffs from 3rd floor (Restaurant). Most of the staffs there are awesome!  Mind you, I will come back from breakfast but not to stay during winter time.  Anyway, their CS gave me an excuse was &quot;It's cold outside, the water pipe need time to warm up&quot;"
298848437,VCBCX1,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",2015-08-13,Vancouver X Inn,"we stayed only for one night with my puppy and the staff was very friendly and sweet. we were provided doggie bags, a water bowl and a couple of treats.there's only a couple floors that allow dogs here which maintains the level of cleanliness and avoids problems for those with allergies!!the rooms were immaculately clean and very spacious! the view (even though we were only on the third floor) was also very beautiful"
465725020,VCBCX1,home,2017-03-08,Vancouver X Inn,"The XT in Burnaby is just 20 min from downtown Vancouver and 30 to the airport. Great central location, clean, and the most friendly staff around! I was there for business and the room service was great, food was awesome, and I can not say enough about all the staff I encounter. On-site self parking in the garage was easy and inexpensive. I would stay again."
169832150,VCBCX1,Hong Kong,2013-07-29,Vancouver X Inn,"This was our 2nd stay at the hotel in 2 years. I wrote a not so good review last time around, but I'm glad to say that management had fixed most items that I was complaining about, and we had a very pleasant stay this time. Staff was quite responsive to our needs. We checked in very late and found that our room has a very bad smell of cigarette smoke, given that no rooms of the same configuration was available, we were offered a smaller room with extra bed for the night, and would be changed back the next day. I was expecting we won't get the new room until check in time the next day, and was surprised to get a phone call that the room is ready at 10am the next morning. Staff clearly put that as a priority, and we appreciate that.The only problem we still had from last time was serious leakage from the bath tub if we have extended showers."
438128908,VCBCX1,"Hong Kong, China",2016-11-17,Vancouver X Inn,"If you are used to the modern hotels in Asia, you may find this particular XT to be old fashion.  The design is more like from the 90's.   I stayed in the Executive Floor Suite but the room was huge, except the decor was quite out of touch with time.   It reminded me of my university apartment instead of a real executive floor suite in the millennium age.   However, I did enjoyed their executive floor lounge (though a bit small) and the hot food and beverages there.  Their staff was very courteous and helpful.   The Metrotown XT had a huge shopping mall in its vicinity and it had a nice food court and miles of retail shops.   However, I found the $360 per room to be a bit high for what I was paying.  It sure was not luxurious like the XTs in Asia. "
357347002,VCBCX1,"Hong Kong, China",2016-03-21,Vancouver X Inn,"XT is usually one of my first choices, and they are good at rewarding loyalty, so I decided to stay here for a weekend.  If you don't know much about Vancouver, it's important to note that this is indeed not in Vancouver, yet it's about a 30 minute drive from the city centre.  Skytrain is a bit quicker. We were upgraded to a suite, which had a larger sitting room, sofas, etc.  The pull-out couch was not so good to sleep on, but they never are. Exec. lounge access was nice, and the spread was also pretty good.  Alcohol is not free, and having to put your card into the door to enter makes it one of the least inviting lounges I've been to. Nice views of the city. You can almost see Vancouver from the higher floors, but not quite."
598130311,VCBCX1,"Hong Kong, China",2018-07-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Seems like no one bothered after giving the room check in card. That general customer service wasnt that pleasant. For an instance, i went for the breakfast and walked over to one of the seats. I was stopped by the manager with a rude tone as if i intruded some private property. You can always be nice to your guests and dont have to act like i commited a crime! Breakfast selection was very poor! However, the room that i got was clean. No bottle water was provided. Basically it was good for sleeping and there is a nearby train station that brings you to the city. A shopping mall and a few eateries are within walking distance. I'd suggest marriot which is next door is wayyyy better!"
502493184,VCBCX1,"Hong Kong, China",2017-07-16,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel itself is adequate and clean. The rooms are very quiet and the location is good. It is a stone's throw away from a big mall and lots of food choices all around. The downside is the safety and security. My best friend parked their car at the basement of the hotel and she lost her bag. The door was forced open and the burglar stole her whole bag. She was so bummed about it and the husband was also feeling inconvenienced because the car door was left damaged because of the forced entry. My stay would have been wonderful if not for the car burglary. Be careful if you are going to park at the basement. This was not an isolated case.
168368788,VCBCX1,"Hong Kong, China",2013-07-20,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here for 1 night in July. Hotel room is very nice and clean. The front desk staff were very helpful.  Complimentary with fantastic breakfast for 4 guests. Excellent location for shopping, there are Asian / Canadian shopping malls nearby. Had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay again."
169241946,VCBCX1,"Hong Kong, China",2013-07-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed for 5 nights on last August.  Hotel was neat and clean, and we had breakfast on the executive floor.  Overall the hotel was up to the standard for this brand name.  It's a quite neighborhood and not much shopping area.  Hotel staffs were well trained and friendly."
450910741,VCBCX1,"Hong Kong, China",2017-01-10,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff was great at this property, and the location is very convenient (next to MetroTown Mall. A great business hotel with generous room space. Parking is a bit of a drag until you get used to it. Otherwise ok."
588255998,VCBCX1,"Hong Kong, China",2018-06-18,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed in XT Metrotown for 3 nights as a annual trip with my close friends. I recommended staying at XT as I have a gold membership there and my previous experience with London XT were quite decent.
562151771,VCBCX1,"Hong Kong, China",2018-02-22,Vancouver X Inn,"XT is the brand promise which providing Excellent Customer Service especially Nelson, Leah, Simon and the lady from housekeeping."
378896873,VCBCX1,"Honolulu, United States",2016-06-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Check in staff was very genuine and sincere. Location is a twenty minute Sky Train ride from Vancouver. The hotel itself is above a chinese plaza where they have a food court, small shops, and grocery market/stands. It was extremely quiet in the rooms.  Across the street is one of the largest indoor malls ever with all shops imaginable (BEHIND the holiday inn/best buy). On the other side of the hotel has a few bars. Be careful of parking in the structure, the sharp turns make it a challenge to navigate. Overall i would definitely stay in this hotel again."
517273574,VCBCX1,"Hope, Canada",2017-08-24,Vancouver X Inn,"We were well looked after and all the family that attended enjoyed the event, unfortunately the guest of honour fell the morning of the event and broke her hip so she was in the hospital not at the party as planned, missed her but the get together was very good."
354711301,VCBCX1,"Hope, Canada",2016-03-11,Vancouver X Inn,"We often stay here becaude of the great service, the price and the location. On our recent stay a few days ago we experienced the best service from a breakfast waiter that we have ever had for decades, highly recommended."
495020761,VCBCX1,houndogoz,2017-06-21,Vancouver X Inn,We chose this hotel not knowing the city layout at all. The hotel is great and conveniently near kings way with many shops and restaurants. Also across the road is a huge shopping mall with everything. However is located about 7km from downtown. But access is easy by bus or the sky train. A cheaper alternative than the more expensive downtown hotels. 
517587791,VCBCX1,"Houston, Texas",2017-08-25,Vancouver X Inn,"We visited Vancouver to celebrate our friends 20th anniversary and had a wonderful experience.  The hotel was simply beautiful as well as the room/suite. The staff was very friendly and made us feel very welcome.  The food was fantastic and seasoned well.  The location was easy to navigate around the city with great eating locations close to the XT Metrotown.  Try Earls and the Catcus restaurants- great food. If you like asian food, the dynesty was ok.  One of the most enjoyable  evening was spent on the Haubor dinner cruise.  There were so many things to do and everyone in the city were friendly and helpful.  The entire city welcomed you.  Great place to stay and great city to visit.  XT properties always do it right.  Anyone who can not enough this hotel, staff and city are just unhappy people to begin with.  Vancouver at its best!!!"
176526937,VCBCX1,"Houston, Texas",2013-09-09,Vancouver X Inn,"I made reservations to stay at this hotel for the night prior to departing on a cruise to Alaska.  I must admit that I did not understand that it was so far away from the cruise dock or downtown Vancouver.  It was, however, located across from the largest shopping mall in Vancouver which provided activities for the afternoon.  We choose to take a cab to the cruise dock due to luggage but could have taken the public transportation elevated tram which is located nearby.  The hotel rooms were nice and clean and looked newly renovated.  We ate at the restaurant and received good quality and service."
374310137,VCBCX1,"Houston, Texas",2016-05-18,Vancouver X Inn,"Hotel is very centrally located for getting around Vancouver (using the Skytrain or if you want to avoid crazy downtown parking fees) as well being next to Metrotown.Room was a nice size with two comfortable queen size beds and a view of metrotown. Room was very clean and house keeping were very attentive.I would recommend joining the XT Honors program, in order to get the free wifi.Very pleasant visit. Good staff, clean, nicely sized rooms and centrally located for shopping and cheap eats."
248381593,VCBCX1,"Houston, Texas",2015-01-08,Vancouver X Inn,"I booked this hotel by accident, thinking it was in the Vancouver downtown. It ended up being a fortunate accident. The hotel valet and entrance are small, but they don't detract from the rest of the hotel. I booked a high room with a corner view, and the view was incomparable. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Had a steak sandwich and chips with a pear cider for lunch. Overall, the entire stay was fantastic."
424457427,VCBCX1,"Houston, Texas",2016-10-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Hotel was very good, clean, and near food and shopping.  Was not as close to downtown Vancouver as I would have liked. Staff was helpful in pointing things to do, and best ways to get there. Cruise package was helpful as it did provide a cab to the port."
235554537,VCBCX1,"Houston, Texas",2014-10-21,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed the night only. The hotel is very plain, the rooms are very plain. Everything is clean, it's just not what XT usually is. The walls are very thin. The breakfast was lovely and I understand there is terrific shopping just out the door."
492297928,VCBCX1,"Houston, Texas",2017-06-11,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel was close by restaurants and shopping.  Was close by public transportation--The Sky Train.  Easy to get around.  Food was good.  Service was great.  Concierge was helpful with directions.  We spent time in Burnaby and Vancouver.
399028791,VCBCX1,"Houston, Texas",2016-07-29,Vancouver X Inn,"Connected to a Chinese mall. This area is new China town. Very good food in food court. Across the street is large mall with major stores and movie theater. Breakfast buffet was fantastic at the hotel, really fresh fruit. "
342056025,VCBCX1,"Houston, Texas",2016-01-22,Vancouver X Inn,this hotel was clean and confortable  also had easy access to metro public transpertation. also there is a mall and good places to eat that are in walking distance. parking is not as expensive as downtown Vancover
382824678,VCBCX1,"Houston, Texas",2016-06-15,Vancouver X Inn,"When I travel there is a certain level of customer service I expect, especially when I hear XT and that was not provided on this visit."
165275603,VCBCX1,"Houston, United States",2013-06-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Average hotel with high price. Don't expect luxury. Very old pool and jacuzzi with spots and cracks. White color in the room all over including ceilings. Old furniture, no microwave or refrigrator. Location was ideal with mall next to the hotel."
240075455,VCBCX1,Hudson&#39;s Hope,2014-11-16,Vancouver X Inn,"I have stayed at this hotel several times and each time I receive good service from the door men, front desk, reservation desk and so on and the housekeeping is very good.  It is in a very handy location situated next to Metrotown and the skytrain so I recommend it just for this fact alone as you can leave your vehicle parked each day why you take transit to your business meetings and then later for entertainment in the evening; or just slip over to Metrotown to dine and shop."
223953436,VCBCX1,"Hudson, Ohio",2014-08-23,Vancouver X Inn,"I have traveled several times to greater Vancouver for business, and this location is probably as good as it gets for business......Vancouver in general isn't easy to get around, but the Metrotown location is pretty good.I found the food to be of good value as was the main breakfast.  I chose not to use the executive lounge for breakfast since it was invaded by a family the night before for cocktail hour.  Just a pet peeve of mine, but kids under 16 shouldn't be allowed in executive lounges.  It makes it anything but relaxing and quiet.Given the high cost of land values in SW British Columbia, it's unreasonable to complain the rooms are on the tiny side (which they are).  It is to be expected.As a diamond member (and an American), I found the staff to be as professional and courteous as anywhere in the States."
201967022,VCBCX1,"Humble, Texas",2014-04-20,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice hotel if you need to be in that part of Vancouver but not ideal to stay at if you need to be in downtown Vancouver. Staff was very friendly and always extremely helpful. Parking in the garage is a bit tight if you have a big vehicle, we had a Ford Expedition."
167978898,VCBCX1,"Huntingdon, United Kingdom",2013-07-17,Vancouver X Inn,"I really didnt expect to like this hotel.  When we arrived very tired after a long flight it looked ill placed next to a building site and clearly in a Chinese/Asia Quarter.  However, at every turn and opportunity the hotel and staff excelled.  The front desk staff are superb right down to having a bottle of water ready for me when I returned from a run (again an excellent recommendation).  We were on the Exec Club floor and had access to the lounge on the 18th floor and had an excellent evening snack which was ideal when we were so tired.  We had some excellent recommendations for dinner which were well made.  We may just have been tired but we all thought the beds and pillows the best we had every expereinced.Location for a toursit is not excellent but the hotel is close to the SkyTrain and about 15 minutes from downtown.  The hotel is growing on us and inparticular the staff attitude is superb.  Thanks all round."
395142707,VCBCX1,"Ibiza, Spain",2016-07-21,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel itself is excellent and staff service was also very good. It is however a 25m Skytrain ride to downtown Vancouver. The Skytrain is a 5m walkaway and linked to a very large shopping mall and retail park which is def. a plus. It's in a residential area and so quiet and safe.Stephanie at checkin was excellent. She could not enough for me. My room was even ready before 3pm. The rooms aren't the most modern but everything worked well and a good size. The wifi worked well with some very good TV channels.I probably wouldn't stay here again because of the location but it does provide value for money in comparison to downtown hotels
224730868,VCBCX1,"Invercargill, New Zealand",2014-08-26,Vancouver X Inn,Nice hotel with very friendly staff. Only half a block away from Metropolis at Metrotown mall and 2 blocks away from the skytrain platform. Dining in the restaurant was nice and reasonably priced. Room was clean and well maintained during our 4 nights stay.
377440550,VCBCX1,itfb,2016-05-28,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here this past week the 25th and 26th of May 2016.  There is nothing especially bad or good about this hotel.  Clean place to stay, internet was OK,  parking on your own is a challenge in an underground lot that never seems to end.  We chose Valet parking it was much easier, the car comes up quickly if you call for it in advance. Breakfast was good, people were nice.  The elevator was a problem, they use key security to get to the room about half the time you have to try multiple times.  Would I stay here again, I don't know, will probably try someplace else next just for the experience.  This location is dead in the center of an Asian community. There are many other businesses in the area as well."
268991721,VCBCX1,"Jackson, United States",2015-04-29,Vancouver X Inn,"It didn't have the exceptional frills that you expect from XT, but it was clean, convenient and the staff extremely helpful and gracious. Right across from Metrotown Mall and within walking distance to the SkyTrain. We had a scheduling snag and the front desk team worked hard to accommodate our needs. The price was the best I could find in the area. Overall we were very pleased with our stay."
515726195,VCBCX1,"Jacksonville, Alabama",2017-08-20,Vancouver X Inn,Enjoyed the stay.  May have preferred something closer to the port. They had clean comfortable rooms and a good breakfast.  Friendly staff.   This hotel met our needs.   Close to a big mall too so great location for shopping. 
215176960,VCBCX1,"Jakarta, Indonesia",2014-07-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Location: next to Cystal mall. Across Metrotown Mall, the biggest mall in vancouver. Along kingsway road, lots of restaurants from vietnamese, koreans, chinese, thai and western. U wont go hungry! 2 mins walk across the street is IGA supermarket. There's money changer too along the same road. 3 mins walk to Metrotown. U find everything there: target, foodcourt, supercenters, restaurants. Try dim sum at Fortune House ( 5 persons cost cad$70). Parking is free. also try Pho Hoa along kingsway rd. Delicious and cheap.Hotel: very safe hotel. Room is BIG. 4 of us fits nicely. Free wifi in the lobby. U can use the same password in the room too. Parking cost cad$11 per night."
172209480,VCBCX1,"Johns Island, South Carolina",2013-08-14,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here for a business / leisure trip in July 2013.  The hotel is very nice and well kept.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the entire Vancouver area.  We had breakfast in the restaurant and the buffet was well stocked and the food was excellent.  We had dinner in the hotel restaurant one evening and the food and service were very good.  My only knock on the hotel is its location.  While the train is only a couple of blocks away, it still takes at least 30 minutes to get downtown.  Most of the trains that we took were packed - standing room only - even at 9 PM.  Overall, this is a nice hotel."
168639911,VCBCX1,"Jupiter, Florida",2013-07-22,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed out in Burnaby for about half the cost of the downtown hotels, and this didn't bother us a bit as we ended up doing very little downtown. The hotel is in excellent condition and a short drive from local attractions.  It also has a metrorail station less than a block away.  It's adjacent to two malls - one a large mall and the other a oriental market with fresh produce and asian merchants.  Service was good, although they lacked a concierge.    The rooms  were comfortable and well appointed."
239601307,VCBCX1,Kamloops,2014-11-12,Vancouver X Inn,"We had an excellent stay!  from clean and spacious rooms, to excellent food however the Customer service is what stood out the most to us.

155171800,VCBCX1,"Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada",2013-03-20,Vancouver X Inn,it was enjoyable and more people should go and visit XT hotel.it is as good as the XT hotel in my country Kenyait is more like a 'home away from home' experience. Since this hotel is in such a central location i choose it over many other hotels. i  took the Sky Train into the city to meet other friends with the help of the receptionists
317003809,VCBCX1,"Kamloops, Canada",2015-10-07,Vancouver X Inn,"I spent my wedding night here with my new wife. Obviously we had a great time, but this is about the Hotel. There were very nice views and the room was really clean. Service was great and the room was very clean. In fact the whole hotel was great. However, I found the brunch was somewhat expensive though not over the top. There's a cheaper breakfast but you have to be up by 10 am which is unfortunate."
265787189,VCBCX1,"Kamloops, Canada",2015-04-14,Vancouver X Inn,Annually I attend a conference held at the XT Vancouver Metrotown in Burnaby British Columbia as well as stay there for several nights.

You won't be disappointed.

490855189,VCBCX1,"Kamloops, Canada",2017-06-05,Vancouver X Inn,"The XT at Metro town always provides excellent service, checking in and out.

491972086,VCBCX1,"Kamloops, Canada",2017-06-10,Vancouver X Inn,This is a 2-3 star hotel. Compact room. Loud and noisy. We will not stay in this hotel again. Complicated parking. Zero variety in shopping and restaurants in building. Division on every floor. This hotel is trying to be too many things at once creating chaos for its guests. 
593411157,VCBCX1,"Kamloops, Canada",2018-07-05,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here on June 23 rd. It is a nice hotel with clean rooms and great breakfast was offered too.

532742608,VCBCX1,"Kamloops, Canada",2017-10-13,Vancouver X Inn,One of the best features of this hotel is the staff. Many have been with the hotel for a long period. They remember guests and do their best to provide excellent service. I really appreciate them and a big reason I return to this hotel. 
502660532,VCBCX1,"Kamloops, Canada",2017-07-16,Vancouver X Inn,Uncomfortable sofa bed and some frayed furniture. Charge for wifi was a surprise.  Thin walls easy to hear neighbouring rooms. Nice view and friendly staff. I thought $329 (plus wifi and parking and taxes) was about $100 over value.  
229546219,VCBCX1,"Kamloops, Canada",2014-09-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Good place to stay for Metrotown shopping.  Ask for the shopping package which includes a mall gift card. VERY comfortable beds, nice view of Burnaby. I enjoyed staying here more than my last visit where I stayed downtown."

475993003,VCBCX1,"Kanata, Canada",2017-04-15,Vancouver X Inn,"Great place to stay. Fantastic food, staff is friendly and beds are very comfortable. They just launched a new pizza which is excellent. I will be back some time in the near future and would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Burnaby area."
311720300,VCBCX1,"Kaneohe, Hawaii",2015-09-18,Vancouver X Inn,The staff was very attentive to our needs.  They answered all our questions and provided great recommendations on getting around the area.  We got precise information on utilizing the Sky Train to get to North Vancouver.  The lounge was great in meeting our expectations.
484954849,VCBCX1,"Kansas City, Missouri",2017-05-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Rooms were clean and spacious, housekeeping team was flexible.   Level 3 had all the food and beverage needs covered.  Great meeting place for our group.  It was nice to have the full buffet or the continental for breakfast.  My daughter was really happy with the fitness center, hours and equipment was up to date.  Perfect location for getting on and off the bus and train systems."
451826479,VCBCX1,"Kansas City, MO, United States",2017-01-13,Vancouver X Inn,"I have stayed at this hotel each year for the past 7 years.  Each time, I am met with friendly staff and made to feel at home.  Not all hotels are created equal.  This one certainly is at the top of my list.  It will always be my first choice when in the area."
222309640,VCBCX1,"Kaohsiung, Taiwan",2014-08-16,Vancouver X Inn,"XT Vancouver Metrotown is at McKay and Kingsway, which is in the heart of Burnaby, with a walking distance to the biggest shopping mall of B.C. - Metrotown, and also just 5 minutes to the bus / sky train station.  It is a very convenient and an excellent hotel to stay."
621446406,VCBCX1,kegs605,2018-10-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Spent 1 night here, in a good location for shopping at metro town. The hot tub was enjoyable. The casino shuttle bus stops out front of property.The rate for the rooms were reasonable and the room spacious and clean"
348712642,VCBCX1,Kelowna,2016-02-17,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a great hotel to stay in when visiting the Lower Mainland and Vancouver area.  It is located across the street from Metrotown Mall which is HUGE!  It is also connected to the Crystal Mall, which is an asian inspired mall with great shops and food.  Try the Bubble tea!  It's located about 5 minutes from the Sky train which will take you right into downtown Vancouver.The staff is wonderful and attentive and fixed a problem we had promptly and went over and above to do so."
449782626,VCBCX1,Kelowna,2017-01-05,Vancouver X Inn,"Location is perfect for shoppers but felt a complimentary breakfast would go a long way for this hotel chain.  Travelling with a sports team with early hockey games it would have been a real perk to have either a complimentary breakfast or a complimentary evening reception.  The neighboring hotels offered both but were totally booked, I will be booking earlier at a neighboring hotel rather than the XT."
612436008,VCBCX1,Kelowna,2018-08-30,Vancouver X Inn,Love this Hotel. Very good staff from the front desk to parking attendant to the housekeeping.  Close to Metro Town Mall and attached to the Crystal Mall with extensive food court. The Sunday Brunch is awesome however you have to shell out $37. pp. Comfy bed and the best Pillows Will return soon
290006042,VCBCX1,Kelowna,2015-07-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Long slow line for check in, non-existent wireless internet that could not be fixed in 1.5 hours with 4 calls to front desk and internet support, otherwise a good room and decent bed and bedding, and decent bathroom."
448730985,VCBCX1,Kelowna BC,2017-01-02,Vancouver X Inn,Chose this hotel due to the proximity to the Sky Train station as we were heading downtown to a hockey game. The front desk staff was amazing and the hotel clean and convenient. I would definitely stay again. Great for shoppers too!
241360752,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada",2014-11-24,Vancouver X Inn,the staff and hotel amenities never let us down. the service is outstanding and the staff are friendly and genuine. we are always incredibly impressed and extremely comfortable here. highly recommend this hotel.
163101258,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2013-06-05,Vancouver X Inn,"Spent 5 nights at the XT in Metrotown on business. The hotel itself is nice and well kept for the most part. I was a little disapointed in the room as it was a little tired and dated and the bathroom sink had a big crack in it. I am surprised that a XT would not have replaced it immediately! The location is very central, although it is beside the old Station Square mall which has been demolished and is just a huge hole waiting for new highrise condos to be built.The staff are friendly and efficient and if not for the room I would have given it 4 stars."
157803657,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2013-04-15,Vancouver X Inn,What a pleasant surprise. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and modern and the bed was super comfortable. We asked for and received a quiet room facing away from traffic and far from the elevator. Shopping was within easy walking distance as MetroTown is just down the street. My only complaint would be the charge for wifi. $8.00 for 24 hours. It probably bothers me because it seems like such a petty cash grab. Just my opinion! All in all a good place to stay and even with the charge for wifi we will likely stay at this hotel again.
274832059,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2015-05-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Very attentive staff and a clean hotel. We were very pleased with the service we recieved from the moment we arrived? Dissapointed however that the pool and hot tub was out of service on the nicest days of our stay but with hockey teams , and other small boys teams there is bound to be something out of sorts. Our bed was broken on the right side ofand was difficult to sleep without being pulled to the outside of the bed...but other then that it was a great location to mymom who lives in New West. Very pet friendly!Rm 418"
550645815,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2018-01-01,Vancouver X Inn,"I am here every week for work. The rooms are always well maintained. The staff are friendly and work very hard to make sure all of my needs are accommodated. This morning the staff in the Reflect Restaurant were amazing as they organized everything from last night's New Years Eve festivities and for setting up the New Years Day Brunch. My server was Lavery, and he was great in making sure I had everything I needed. I really appreciate how well everyone takes care of me."
253450613,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2015-02-09,Vancouver X Inn,We decided to have a long weekend getaway and booked two nights here and stayed in one the executive rooms. The room we stayed in was really nice and clean.The hotel was in a perfect location for shopping and transit making getting around quit easy to do.The breakfast and evening food in the Executive lounge was so worth the few extra dollars.We will be back to this hotel in the future and always book an executive room.
352989949,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2016-03-04,Vancouver X Inn,"This was a wonderful stay.  I felt nothing but welcome. I need to put extra focus on the staff at reflect lounge that completely made the stay worth while.  I cannot express what an asset Steve and Cecilia are, they are warm, welcoming and the epitome of fabulous service.  These are the staff that certainly deserve an employers investment.  I know that if they were under my employ I would value their insight."
272340573,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2015-05-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here twice in the last month. Love the location to the major mall and sky train station to downtown. XT honor member gets wifi, parking, top floor lounge with comp snacks and non alcoholic beverages. Excellent buffet breakfast in morning is complimentary too! Keurig machines in rooms, not just coffee. Large rooms nicely appointed and great customer service both times. Will be back!!"
407318398,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2016-08-18,Vancouver X Inn,"Staff at Burnaby XT Metrotown are all very professional and are excellent at making you feel like you're at home with their relaxed, friendly styles. Location is excellent and always tell friends that it's a great location to be able to see the entire city especially using the Skytrain and public transit. Other amenities such as Metrotown Mall there for any needs you may have."
167839194,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2013-07-16,Vancouver X Inn,I stayed here wit my wife over the Canada day long weekend and was totally impressed.The front desk staff were extremely helpful and very outreached.Had breakfast and brunch at the reflect 2 times in 3 days and it was fantastic.I am a foodie and i consider hard to please but I was impressed with the overall hotel and restaurant.Will definitely come back.
200773221,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2014-04-11,Vancouver X Inn,"Although the Metro Town Mall is under construction and the convenience is not the usual, this hotel is very centrally located to the Mall and several good restaurants. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the facilities are clean and updated and the rooms are very nice. I would recommend a stay here when visiting Burnaby."
471741681,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2017-03-31,Vancouver X Inn,Tried this hotel for proximity to the sky train into Vancouver. This hotel is ok. Best part is that it is close to a big shopping mall. Parking is $12 and the staff says that everyone has to pay that price. No exceptions.   Have wanted to stay here for a while to try it out. Probably would not choose to stay here again. 
467980835,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2017-03-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Everything is pretty much perfect on all subjects. The only thing to complain about is the room. The windows don't open for air. But I understand why. For a lot reasons one of which is the traffic noise. That would drive me nuts at the end of a long day. But it is Vancouver after all, how do you stop traffic noise?"
263646603,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2015-04-04,Vancouver X Inn,The XT hotel is in a great location close to the mall for great shopping and sky train to whip into the city and back. You will find lots of great restaurants in walking distance. Staff and service were excellent. Best value for the star ratings in Vancouver hands down. Will be back again in May! Thank you. 
465478958,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2017-03-07,Vancouver X Inn,"I have been staying at the XT Metrotown for both business and pleasure for many years and have always appreciated the courteous, helpful staff. They go out of their way to make things right in every situation. The location is great next to Metrotown Mall and the restaurant is excellent as well."
256642714,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2015-02-20,Vancouver X Inn,"Located in a prime area with excellent service and lovely rooms.  The staff are extremely helpful, the rooms are beautiful, and the restaurant is fantastic. Very convenient to Metrotown Mall, Sky Train, and only a few minutes drive to downtown Vancouver."
232999472,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2014-10-06,Vancouver X Inn,The staff were friendly and helpful even when i did not ask for it.  Everything was made effortless so there was no frustration or stress involved in coming or going from the hotel.  They anticipated my needs. i would return again.
205231179,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2014-05-12,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed at this hotel as part of a wedding party May 9th and 10th, 2014. All hotel staff were very accommodating - valet, front desk, restaurant, housekeeper. Left a voice mail with the general manager because we were so pleased."
221486860,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2014-08-12,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice rooms, nice lobby, nice pools. Hot tub was hardly hot though. Unfortunately the maid staff woke up our family by talking loudly in the hallway in the early morning. A staff member in the restaurant was less than sanitary."
168806881,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2013-07-23,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel was great for our stay.  It was close to shopping and fairly central.  Staff friendly and accommodating.  Rooms were very nice.  Only negative was Pool is small, lap pool, but okay if you just wanna relax pool side."
585074269,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2018-06-04,Vancouver X Inn,"Great facility, close to transit, shopping. Fantastic breakfast and service. The maid service was fantastic. If you would like to explore Vancouver make sure you take the skytrain a short 5 minute walk to the skytrain"
216519678,VCBCX1,"kelowna, Canada",2014-07-20,Vancouver X Inn,everyone was very professional. The hotel and room were very clean.  The beds were very comfortable. We would definitely use this hotel again.  It was in a great location right near the sky train and metrotown mall.
494734029,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2017-06-20,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent Hotel. Friendly, very helpful staff and great location for food choices, shopping and access to sky train.  The rooms are very spacious, clean and the beds are very comfortable. Excellent family hotel."
202182335,VCBCX1,"Kelowna, Canada",2014-04-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Soccer team was on the same floor, so it was loud.  The restaurant lacked a varied menu, maybe try dining else where if you choose this hotel.  20 mins to downtown, so nice to be close without being downtown"
422308881,VCBCX1,"Kent, Washington",2016-09-25,Vancouver X Inn,"For a XT hotel, the place was nice, but we expected better service.  We decided to order breakfast to our room; we filled out the order card and placed it on our doorknob the night before so that the attendant could pick it up and have the food brought at the designated time the following morning.  The card did not get picked up, I called the front desk.  The lady did not apologize, and just said that they would have some come get it.  After an hour, no one came up.  So we had to physically go down to the front desk and complain.  To her credit, the assistant manager apologized and gave us vouchers for a meal in the buffet lounge and placed our order for the following morning.  While all was well in the end, I expected more from a name brand hotel chain like XT."
473072089,VCBCX1,"Kitimat, Canada",2017-04-05,Vancouver X Inn,"We attended an annual live arts touring conference and the hotel treated us very well as usual. Even though we were a very large group, the staff remained friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the service is excellent."
549114461,VCBCX1,"Kyoto, Japan",2017-12-25,Vancouver X Inn,The location is good as it's close to the skytrain station. However one of the ladies at the reception was rude and the room was small. The lounge was ok but food selection was limited. There's an Asian mall next to the hotel.
224733410,VCBCX1,"La Jolla, California",2014-08-26,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is one block from the Metrotown metro station, which is 20 minutes from downtown Vancouver City Center metro station.  It sits adjacent to Crystal Mall, which has mainly Chinese stores, including restaurants.  To or from the airport, you need to go to downtown Vancouver first and change train, that is, two sides of a triangle, which takes about an hour.  Because I am a XT Gold member, I was upgraded to a suite with free wi-fi, which was nice.  The living room has a queen-size sofa bed, so the suite can accommodate 4 adults easily."
250731216,VCBCX1,"Ladysmith, Canada",2015-01-22,Vancouver X Inn,"We have stayed at this hotel several times  over the years mainly because of its location, proximty to a major shopping mall, and minutes to downtown, especially via sky train.   The staff are always pleasant, helpful, and accommodating."
423568362,VCBCX1,"Lafayette, Louisiana",2016-09-29,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here in Burnaby for 4 days to attend a local business conference in the area. The XT was located near the Sky Train, Metro Town Mall  and many restaurants and shops.   My room was comfortable and large.  The workout faculty on the 2nd floor was small but worked well for me and others at 5 am. It was also busy!  We tried the bar and had a great visit and experience there as well. Overall, this is a nice XT hotel in Metro Town where you can shop or get on the Sky train for downtown. All in all, the service was equally as good taking care of any needs I had. I would recommend anyone stay here of the location or if coming off a cruise ship. Just cant go wrong staying here!"
398421440,VCBCX1,"Lake Louise, Canada",2016-07-28,Vancouver X Inn,$343.00 for a room for one night....ok summer time and busy ...book early get a better deal. Hotel door often crashed into bathroom door...not a good design. Rooms were clean but very average. Breakfast was $21 ...went to Tim Hortons! Pool was small. long line up at checking desk morning and evening ...employ more staff?
210711624,VCBCX1,"Lake Villa, Illinois",2014-06-17,Vancouver X Inn,"When I arrived in front of the hotel, a greeter provided my underground parking instructions, and gave me a parking pass along with instructions how to take the elevator to the lobby. He then followed my car down to make sure zoo got a good parking place. At check in I was upgraded to the executive floor as a Gold elite member, and this entitled me to a nice free dinner. One strange thing, drinks....alcohol drinks carried a $6 charge which surprised me.Nice people, BEAUTIFUL views of the nearby mountains and cityscape, great hotel"
527698331,VCBCX1,"Lakefield, Canada",2017-09-26,Vancouver X Inn,"We choose this hotel for the central location and price after being on a cruise.  The room was clean, bright and spacious.  Sadly our view was one of a construction site along with the noise starting early in the morning.  We were also locked out of our room while it was being cleaned which was a little disconcerting and inconvenient. That being said I know we can always expect a certain level of service, cleanliness and over-all feel from any XT establishment and I would recommend this hotel."
197109735,VCBCX1,"Lakewood, Washington",2014-03-11,Vancouver X Inn,Super clean! It meets all XT standards! Friendly staff that makes you feel welcome and secure!Location is just super! Close to the local train station which takes you to Vancouver's downtown in less than 20 min! (Safely).Close to the hotel there a HUGE mall!!!
331744636,VCBCX1,"Langley BC, Canada",2015-12-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Very Clean Hotel. The location is a BIG plus. Just a block away from the shopping mall at Metrotown. Very friendly staff, always willing to help. I will stay here again. Good value for money. The breakfast is also very good with good choices between hot and cold meal"
329119221,VCBCX1,"Langley, Canada",2015-11-25,Vancouver X Inn,The XT Metrotown is a great hotel.   Met friends for drinks and dinner at the lounge and booked a room to stay so we did not drink and drive.   Hotel is extremely clean and the service all around is excellent. Would highly recommend for pleasure or business.
275211748,VCBCX1,"Langley, Canada",2015-05-27,Vancouver X Inn,Hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly.  Obviously run very well.  Close to major shopping and sky train to get around.  Best choice for the area and even if you want to go downtown Vancouver this is a great location as easy to get there.
245800355,VCBCX1,"langley, Canada",2014-12-24,Vancouver X Inn,"Room was good. Food at the company Christmas party was fair only.The food at morning complimentary  buffet was not good as far as the hot food, most disappointing. The service and appys in the lounge were great. Will stay again"
300276643,VCBCX1,"Lansing, Illinois",2015-08-17,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel offers free hotel shuttle to and from the airport. The hotel is right in front of the rail system that will take you around the Vancouver area. There is a restaurant and bar right on the property.
299744525,VCBCX1,"Las Cruces, New Mexico",2015-08-15,Vancouver X Inn,"Upgraded to a King-bed suite. Large and quite room. Well furnished. Nice selections in the Executive Lounge, but bit cramped. The hotel is bit far from downtown and attractions, but very close to the SkyTrain station."
155889072,VCBCX1,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2013-03-28,Vancouver X Inn,"I cannot say enough about the excellent, friendly service and location of the Metrotown XT.  As mentioned in other reviews, the location is fantastic -  a couple of  blocks from Metrotown mall and access to Vancouver's extensive skytrain system. Pretty much anything you could want is steps away.  We are hhonors gold and have always been offered a free room upgrade to a suite and comps for breakfast. (For golds, there is a very small upcharge for the full, hot breakfast buffet - well worth it)   Evening hors d'oeuvres in the view executive suite on the 18th floor are more extensive than you would expect (incl. warm chicken satay recently - yum!). Staff went out of their way to answer questions and make us feel at home.  Other XT properties could learn a lot from these folks!"
364292706,VCBCX1,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2016-04-14,Vancouver X Inn,"There is massive construction across the street from this hotel. A large number of the hotel rooms in this property face the construction site which is quite loud and starts working early. We were not told of this at check-in. We instead found out when we were woken to loud construction equipment noises early after the first night of our stay. Parking is difficult to get in and out of during the day and expensive. We chose this hotel because the reviews seemed ok and the rate was good, but I strongly suggest spending a bit more to stay anywhere else until the construction is done."
489091366,VCBCX1,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2017-05-30,Vancouver X Inn,"Great service, close to attractions and fabulous mall.  Lots to do in Vancouver.  Staff was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about what to do and where to go.  We would definitely stay there again as the Skytrain takes you anywhere you want to go.  "
550701578,VCBCX1,"Las Vegas, Nevada",2018-01-01,Vancouver X Inn,Awesome experience!!! Would definitely stay here again!!! Franco and the staff are amazing!!!! Very smooth check in and helpful staff the entire stay!!! Rooms were very spacious and clean... housekeeping very good as well!
512650626,VCBCX1,"Las Vegas, United States",2017-08-13,Vancouver X Inn,My stay at XT Vancouver was awesome! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and spacious. Overall experience was fantastic! My family loved this location and I will recommend this hotel to my friends and co-workers.
219929275,VCBCX1,"Lawton, Oklahoma",2014-08-05,Vancouver X Inn,XT properties are our choice when traveling but here was quiet and housekeeping didn't expect us to be out of our room until afternoon! The market next door is fun to go through as well as the huge mall nearby. The Sky Train and Bus Center is a few blocks away giving you access to the entire city of Vancouver!
522485984,VCBCX1,"League City, United States",2017-09-07,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel is in Burnaby about 30 minutes out of Vancouver. But the Sky Train is a close walk and makes it easy to get to downtown Vancouver and the Vancouver harbor. The Hotel is great and the staff is awesome.
392309397,VCBCX1,"Lethbridge, Canada",2016-07-13,Vancouver X Inn,There was a construction site accross the street so the view wasn't great.  The breakfast menu was ok but the eggs Benedict was terrible and the worst I'd ever eaten.  The linens had quite a strong odor that resulted in me having an adthma reaction.  It was s good thing Bed Bath and Beyond was accross the street.  I just didn't need Orr want to purchase anothe pillow.
383525856,VCBCX1,"Lexington, Ky.",2016-06-17,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is very close to the Sky Train, so easy to get around. The hotel itself offered a clean comfortable room, friendly attentive service and as we used points, a great value. I really did not understand why they invested in an outdoor swimming pool as the weather there is cool to cold and wet a lot of the time. We did not use the pool.There is a large mall within easy walking distance and several restaurants plus of course the large food court at the mall. The wifi was very good."
368758507,VCBCX1,"Lincoln, Nebraska",2016-04-29,Vancouver X Inn,"We decided to stay at this hotel because it was close to where we were going to compete in a floral design competition.  To our surprise it was also convenient to the sky train so we had no trouble getting to the sights we wanted to visit.  The hotel is a little in need of a face lift in the lobby but our room was terrific and had all the things we needed.  I always appreciate having a safe, makeup mirror and a bath mat.  The room was well equipped and clean.  We stayed on the executive level and loved the breakfast and evening appetizers. We plan to stay again in September.  Great hotel for the money!"
418538781,VCBCX1,"Lincoln, Nebraska",2016-09-14,Vancouver X Inn,This was our second stay in three months.  We appreciate the location of the hotel as it is close to the meeting venue and convenient to the Skytrain.  We had use of the Opal Lounge which is terrific.  The breakfast is as good as it gets and the evening spread is ample.  The room was clean and the hotel staff is extremely helpful and pleasant.
427088616,VCBCX1,"Lisbon, Portugal",2016-10-11,Vancouver X Inn,"I used to stay at the XT - close to Metrotown, sporting events etc... so we gave it a shot.  The staff were helpful and kind.  The desk staff, valet and housekeeping were fantastic.  The room was spotlessly clean (thanks Isabelle) but the shared spaces were well below what we expected.  For instance the grimy passage you walk up to get to the pool was dirty enough I wouldn't walk it barefoot.  the pool itself was fun for the kids swim team.  The lap pool (2m x 10m) is nice but it does a stairway (with metal pole) coming down on one end (one child swam right into it!)The unexpect high was seeing the crystal mall's food court.  Fantastic bubble team!Parking was near capacity at all times - and during rush hour it took me almost 10min to exit the parkade.  Plan ahead."
581144280,VCBCX1,London,2018-05-18,Vancouver X Inn,A tall building which was a great landmark if yoi ever got lost.Found some of the staff a bit lazy whilst others were really helpful.Big airy rooms just a short walk away from all the hubbub and pulsating nightlife.Comfortable room in a pleasant and safe area there is even an off licence ( liquor store) semi adjacent to the hotel.Approx 10 mins to sea port by cab so a nice location all round.
400504367,VCBCX1,london,2016-08-02,Vancouver X Inn,We booked three nights (tonight being our last night) in a one bed suite at the XT Vancouver Metrotown.  All the staff are v friendly and nice (only exception Sylvie).  
597182719,VCBCX1,"London, Canada",2018-07-17,Vancouver X Inn,"I was there for a conference at Simon Fraser University, which was about 20 minutes away up Burnaby Mountain.  The hotel is central in Burnaby, steps away from LOTS of shopping.  There are many restaurants and transit is a short walk.  There is a liquor store, restaurants and other useful places nearby.  The hotel, while a little bit dated in spots, was in great shape.  The water pressure was great, the cooling was quiet and worked well.  My room was very large - a suite.  Others were not as large.  The hotel has a restaurant/bar and ample indoor parking (at a price).  the room cleaning service was very good in that I was running a weird schedule and they seemed to work around it.   Would stay there again."
551215027,VCBCX1,"London, Canada",2018-01-03,Vancouver X Inn,Worst night ever first told us that we could check in early came at the 3pm for check in room wasn't ready  had to go sit in the bar and wait till they call you .waited till 5pm went back to the desk to ask if the room was ready they told me that it was ready half an hour ago but they didn't call us like they said they would.didnt get in till about 5pm dinner started at 6pm rooms suck had a suite wouldn't stay there very again go to the holiday inn across the road instead and the XT charges for parking also which is very cheap on there part not even downtown understand but Burnaby bc  really river rock suite was much better
593116289,VCBCX1,"London, Canada",2018-07-04,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a really comfy place to stay. There is some construction going on, but that doesnâ€™t bother the hotel or your stay. The hotel is in close vicinity of the Skytrain to downtown. Enough restaurants in the direct surroundings and a nice shopping mall.Staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. For business guests there is a nice lounge available. Very quiet place."
602665977,VCBCX1,"London, United Kingdom",2018-08-04,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at the hotel for over a week, on the whole a good choice as the location is very convenient.  Easy access to Metrotown Mall, short walk to the Skytrain station and bus station.  There are a few restaurants in walking distance, also Tim Hortons, Subway to grab a quick bite, grocery stores etc.  There is a lot of building work going on opposite the hotel but this didn't cause any disturbance. Hotel itself was clean but does need a bit of modernisation.  Gym was very cold (AC turned up very high and non adjustable) and early on a weekend can get quite full - limited machines.  Disappointed with lack of bottled water - staying for quite a few nights I would expect to be given water each day - not the case for this hotel.  Staff were friendly enough but could be better, and on our last day did have a run in with the bellboy.Overall a pleasant stay."
213566707,VCBCX1,"London, United Kingdom",2014-07-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Great hotel. Unsure of the problems others had after reading other reviews, but my stay was fantastic - the staff were friendly, the rooms were spacious and clean and their is a variety of food options as well.  My parents stayed in another room to mine which I didn't find as nice as mine - I would recommend asking for a room that has a high floor, but also that faces the skytrain as the view is better. Both of these things should reduce the noise as well.  I wasn't overly impressed with the value of the evening meals, but they were good. Breakfast is a good shout as their are good options and it's served from 6am-11am.  The Metrotown shopping centre is a 5 minute walk away where you can shop for groceries as well as find fast food restaurants as alternative food options.  I would re-book without hesitation next time I'm in Vancouver."
426055278,VCBCX1,"London, United Kingdom",2016-10-08,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is what you would expect from a XT. Clean, good sized rooms etc. The only problem is the distance to downtown, the train journey is long-winded and the airport by train is very inconvenient. Also, very disappointing we were unable to leave our luggage at the branch downtown on the day we checked out of the Burnaby branch. We just wanted to leave our luggage to save us having to get the train all the way back before heading back in the same direction to the hotel. With such a large chain and the cost of a stay relatively expensive, I thought this would have been something they would have been able to do to show good customer service. "
551479417,VCBCX1,"London, United Kingdom",2018-01-04,Vancouver X Inn,"My family and I had one big room which accommodated 4 adults very comfortably.The rooms were very spacious.Had an issue with hot water and when I spoke to Anthony Kim at front desk, he was very apologetic, extremely professional and courteous in resolving the issue. A credit to the XT chain.Hotel is opposite the biggest mall in BC and very handy to visit other parts of BC and beyond."
350984797,VCBCX1,"London, United Kingdom",2016-02-25,Vancouver X Inn,"While conveniently located and clean, I was disappointed with the service and food at this hotel. The lounge food was mediocre, I found mold on my toast and did not get apologies when I complained. The bill for the room was shoved halfway underneath my door (not in a sealed envelope) and so my personal details were exposed to anyone who passed by. Again no apologies when I complained."
317009443,VCBCX1,"London, United Kingdom",2015-10-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here for a week on a conference. Actually very good overall for the area but soon frustrated. Why!Because the wifi in my room is just not good enough. Can't stream music or you tube etc. Cone on. In the current age for a business hotel there is no excuse. So frustrating it undermines the nice service culture you have. People great. Infrastructure, oh really."
352025887,VCBCX1,"London, United Kingdom",2016-02-29,Vancouver X Inn,Pay attention to the location of this hotekl. If you're purpose of visit is leisure this is probably not the ideal hotel for you. If you're on business then it might be just perfect. I needed to enter 200 characther for this review so here's some blurb to pad it out a bit!
180849535,VCBCX1,"Long Newton, United Kingdom",2013-10-13,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed here for a night before joining a cruise.The staff were all very courteous.The breakfast was great.Our room was spacious.The bed was very comfortable.The area is ok with a large shopping mall close by.
198329315,VCBCX1,"Los Altos, California",2014-03-22,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at the XT Metrotown for a couple of nights.  Everyone was good - although there's nothing to write home about.  Room is fairly decent.  Service is typical XT quality too.  The hotel is indeed connected to the food court of a shopping center, making food choices plentiful.  There's also a shopping mall within walking distance too."
161834654,VCBCX1,Los Angeles,2013-05-25,Vancouver X Inn,First I want to say if you are only staying for a few nights or not eating at the hotel the rooms are great. They are little suites and the housekeeping staff is excellent even though I did not use them everyday. As a diamond member the lounge is a great extra at night but the restaurant in the morning was not very good. I had vouchers being a diamond member so I went downstairs so I could use the gym a little later. The eggs benedict was cold. That was all I tried to eat on that side of the buffet. They then charged me for the hot buffet which I did not eat because it was cold. Not great service to notice that and after I said something. Otherwise good hotel. Parking is not fantastic but its traveling.
286916038,VCBCX1,Los Angeles,2015-07-08,Vancouver X Inn,"The service and staff have an amazing attitude at this hotel especially the valet and the breakfast staff. We stayed here for four nights and we loved it. It's conveniently located close to the train, mall, central park and central to many areas such as granville (25 minutes) the victoria ferry (45 minutes) and grouse mountain (25 minutes). It's clean and nice all around. We got upgraded to a view room double queen but there was some construction accross the street so the beeping noise on the excavators was on early around 7 a.m. It wasn't too bad but would have been nice if it wasn't there. Highly recommended."
217845245,VCBCX1,Los Angeles,2014-07-27,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed 4 nights here.  Clean and quiet hotel. The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk to the skytrain.  Lots of parking underground, though it's fills up in the evening. The front desk was quite helpful. For XT diamond members, there's free food in the morning and evening. The staff were all helpful and friendly.  There's quite a bit of traffic in the surrounding area of the hotel."
274851930,VCBCX1,"Los Angeles, California",2015-05-26,Vancouver X Inn,"We were looking for a less expensive option in the Vancouver area and didn't mind the drive from Burnaby.  Less than 30 minutes drive to almost everywhere we wanted to go. Got a great deal on the XT.com website. Front desk team was smiling, professional, and cheerful.  I received an upgrade due to my status and the room was great. Great housekeeping. Hotel is well maintained throughout. Self parking is ample, even if the parking lot is a bit of a tight squeeze. Convenient to both Metrotown mall and SkyTrain. Very good stay and excellent value for the money."
234432839,VCBCX1,"Los Angeles, California",2014-10-14,Vancouver X Inn,"This was the only XT property that was near my meeting. My hotel room was spacious and well decorated complete with fridge. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful with directions and temporary valet. However, self-parking was challenging (it was difficult to find a space as the parking structure is shared with the mall so specific parking spots have to be used) and expensive considering I self-parked. It was also a little difficult to find given the one way streets.   The wifi didn't seem to work very well with my computer or my phone."
442768391,VCBCX1,"Los Angeles, California",2016-12-07,Vancouver X Inn,"The location was a good trade off from staying in downtown comparing rates. The Asian food court next door and the number of other restaurants all in walking distance is also a plus, although not for those looking for typical mall restaurants. The concierge lounge had more actual food than just appetizers and the service was good. I booked the one bedroom suite and it was worth it for the extra space. The metro stop is just across the adjacent shopping center, very convenient. "
425338560,VCBCX1,"Los Angeles, California",2016-10-05,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed at this hotel for business on two separate occasions. Rooms are great and the staff is always pleasant. If you stay on the executive floors, you have access to complimentary continental breakfast which was great as it saved me time in the mornings before heading out to work. Hotel is across from one of the biggest malls in town and is located near tons of restaurants."
589578471,VCBCX1,"Los Angeles, California",2018-06-21,Vancouver X Inn,Thing we liked is tge location below the hotel street food and fresh fruits nice location view from our room people walking around sky traim new construction.. near some grocery.  Service is good ftiendly front desk. Wish with the price breakfast is included 
396054898,VCBCX1,"Los Angeles, California",2016-07-23,Vancouver X Inn,"Awesome hotel, location to eateries plentiful and nearby amenities to attractions very convenient. Staff at this hotel is excellent and breakfast is great!  You will NOT be disappointed and enjoy this fine hotel."
502308993,VCBCX1,"Los Angeles, California",2017-07-15,Vancouver X Inn,The room was pricey for the quality. There was mold in the shower. The couches were very worn and torn. $300 a night - not worth it. For being a XT - I am surprised with the mold in the shower. Shocked. 
616261359,VCBCX1,"Los Angeles, California, USA",2018-09-13,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed for four days during a small vacation to Vancouver. Upon arriving at the lobby I was greeted by the person at the counter, who was all smiles and looked happy to help me check in. The process was rather quickly and I was quickly given a room key. I had room service the first night and the food was great, and the desserts were amazing. The food is definitely made to order and fresh. The rooms were standard and did look a bit dated considering Ive been at other XT hotels, but the rooms were very clean and functioning. "
239259704,VCBCX1,"Los Angeles, United States",2014-11-10,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel staff are extremely professional and helpful.  Facility is well kept and location is good. Executive lounge was wonderful.  My only problem with this hotel was the painfully slow internet offered.
468359844,VCBCX1,"Lumby, Canada",2017-03-18,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff at the XT are always caring and willing to go the extra mile for every one. It's wonderful to be treated so well away from home. The cleanliness of the room each day was outstanding, as well as the lobby staff being very helpful arranging for taxis."
447676175,VCBCX1,"Lynnwood, United States",2016-12-29,Vancouver X Inn,This is a full service hotel close to all shopping and dining conveniences. The room was very good as was the service. We stayed over Christmas and really enjoyed ourselves. They also were happy to accommodate our pet dog. I recommend this hotel.
313085953,VCBCX1,"Macau, China",2015-09-23,Vancouver X Inn,"Not posh nor wow... just the right place with an exquisite serviceIt is rare to find a place from a large chain like this where staff does not over do it and seem to be really true to themselves: helpful, dedicated, niceNot in the center of Vancouver, but very convenient to commute and get there easily by car or monorail... not much to experience around, just the real life of people leaving and working hear... pretty genuine. When in the area, for sure I'll return here!"
394499578,VCBCX1,"Magnolia, Texas",2016-07-19,Vancouver X Inn,"This is an nice hotel with suites that are really suites.  Some hotels misuse that word...  The room was clean and spacious with everything you need...  The location is continent to the Sky-Train which can take you into down town.  Parking is located underground beneath the hotel with direct access to the lobby.  There are malls located nearby, and a wide selection of ethnic restaurants nearby.  The area is safe to walk around, although we were never out to late in the evening... "
193542055,VCBCX1,"Maple Ridge, Canada",2014-02-09,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel was beautiful and clean.  Secure underground parking; comfortable king size bed with too many pillows, lol.But the piece de resistance was the breakfast buffet.  Many many choices and I was asked if I wanted eggs Benedict or omelet as well.  I am a sucker for the bennie.  My server was right on the ball with the coffee top up.  Ask for Robert.Do yourself a favour and forget about Expedia and book the bed and breakfast directly."
600927929,VCBCX1,"Maple Ridge, Canada",2018-07-29,Vancouver X Inn,"My husband and I had a 1 night stay at the XT Metrotown and we would highly recommend this hotel.  Staff were extremely helpful and friendly, at the front door, at the reception desk, and in the restaurant.  Our corner suite had a beautiful view of the mountains, as well as being spacious and spotlessly clean.  The room was also very quiet and we had a great sleep, which is unusual in a hotel.  We would definitely go back! "
197346896,VCBCX1,"Maple Ridge, Canada",2014-03-13,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is a hidden treasure.  Clean, generous sized rooms, friendly staff and the food in their restaurant is positively wonderful.  One blemish was the rudeness of the morning restaurant hostess, but maybe she was just having a bad day.  Overall, a great stay and highly recommend this hotel."
173730144,VCBCX1,Maryland,2013-08-23,Vancouver X Inn,"We tried to book a room at the XT Garden Inn in downtown Vancouver, but it was sold out. That hotel recommended this one as an alternative. This hotel was a high-rise in the town of Burnaby. Parking was $9/day for guests. Burnaby is an ethnic neighborhood with a large shopping mall and great Asian restaurants. The sky-train was approximately 3-4 blocks away. The trip to downtown Vancouver took about 20 minutes. Trains were frequent.The hotel and our room was clean. Breakfast in the hotel was expensive, so my husband walked one block to the grocery store and brought back fruit/muffins. We also grabbed sandwiches for the road at the Subway, also one block away.Wi-fi was only free in the lobby, so my kids spent some time down there.If you insist on staying at a XT property and can't stay in downtown Vancouver, this is a reasonable alternative."
436507640,VCBCX1,"Maryland, United States",2016-11-11,Vancouver X Inn,"Good value, convenient location, excellent services. good views from high floor rooms, courteous staff, nice breafast and evening hors d'oeuvres in Excecutive Lounge. Parking was little confused. Good choice in Burnaby."
487514409,VCBCX1,Mauritius,2017-05-24,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is about three minutes walk from Metrotown mall and public transport. It is also within a building with shops that sell Chinese goods and restaurants. Had a suite which was very comfortable, gym is compact, threadmills, bikes and rowing machine. Executive lounge rather small, items served are somewhat basic. I booked to use XT Honors points and gave wrong dates which had passed. Further to request, front office manager graciously refunded my points... gesture much appreciated. "
248236642,VCBCX1,Mauritius,2015-01-08,Vancouver X Inn,been there the second time and still appreciate the warmth of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms. only hiccup is the breakfast which lacks variety. another good point is they now have inroom safe. otherwise good place with access to metropolis shopping centre and the busloop /skyrail station.
181696214,VCBCX1,Mauritius,2013-10-20,Vancouver X Inn,stayed there for nearly 3 weeks. comfortable spacious and clean room. good location to the metrotown shopping centre and also the skyrail and bus terminal. foodstores hypermarkets electronic shop and small chinese corner close to the hotel. niceand clean environment all around.
420468261,VCBCX1,Mckinney,2016-09-19,Vancouver X Inn,"In a quick nutshell.....we have stayed at numerous XTs across the world and just had the opportunity to stay at this property last week.....three words can best sum up the experience.....BEST IN CLASS!!!! The staff were amazing, the rooms beautiful, the location awesome......wonderful!!!"
366505143,VCBCX1,"Medicine Hat, Canada",2016-04-22,Vancouver X Inn,We were looking for a place in good proximity to downtown without having to pay &quot;downtown&quot; rates.  The XT was only a couple of blocks from the skytrain which took about 15 - 20 min. to downtown so it was great.  There is a huge mall across the street if you like mall shopping.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  We arrived early (about 10:00AM) and they couldn't get us into the room we had requested but did offer another room which is great considering check-in isn't til 3:00.  We opted to keep our bags in the bellroom and come back later to check in the the room we had chosen.
290587478,VCBCX1,"Meerbusch, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany",2015-07-19,Vancouver X Inn,"We arrived to Vancouver from Paris. The XT Vancouver Metrotown was not really what we expected. Starting with the positiv: the room we had was a Dbl twin. A good size for a family with one child. Large TV, good quality boxspring beds all fine. The public areas are average. The pool and fitness center got a big minus and is more like &quot;we have also something&quot; however nothing to spend some quality time. All together the hotel is good for a one night stay. Not really a XT quality and everything a bit older."
389945659,VCBCX1,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-07-06,Vancouver X Inn,We were very disappointed that the price of the room did not include internet access or parking. Almost every hotel these days offers free wifi a big name like the XT should too. The location wasn't very central and considering everywhere in Vancouver has picturesque mountain the view out a window was very of concrete buildings. On the plus side the rooms were very clean and the front desk staff were very friendly! 
420703440,VCBCX1,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-09-20,Vancouver X Inn,"First time stay at this XT, must say it was exceptional, staff were obliging,we enjoyed a suite as an upgrade along with the use of the executive facilities, the hotel is close to Metropolis Mall and Metro Skyrail to downtown.   For all who stay XT this is one of the best."
579984286,VCBCX1,"Melbourne, Australia",2018-05-13,Vancouver X Inn,"While searching for hotel room in downtown Vancouver, the room rate for 4 to 5 stars hotel is so high, I have eventually selected XT in Metrotown. The price is better, and the location is in fact better than my original thought as it is so close to the train station."
385727945,VCBCX1,"Melbourne, Australia",2016-06-24,Vancouver X Inn,"The room is spacious and well done. The corridor is wide and spacious. The restaurants need a bit of dÃ©cor. Looks a bit bland and tacky. Otherwise perfect spot, centrally located and close to the Metro Town Mall."
291433979,VCBCX1,"Melle, Belgium",2015-07-22,Vancouver X Inn,The XT Vancouver Metrotown is not up to XT standards. Room size and cleanliness was OK.  The pool and fitness center are old and not pleasant at all. The kitchen fume outlets are next to the pool so the smell is always present. The pool is not well maintained and not safe as it needs to be refurbished. The breakfast service was not good. The Wifi is very slow. I would not recommend this hotel.
390901625,VCBCX1,"Memphis, Tennessee",2016-07-09,Vancouver X Inn,"All the things from a XT you would expect, this hotel pretty much delivers. Clean, good service, etc. The shared parking garage cost $12 per day and it took an average of 20 min to find a parking spot in the small allotment of spaces given to the hotel. If you book without breakfast allowance DO NOT EAT HERE. Breakfast is a buffet and EXPENSIVE."
517273326,VCBCX1,"Memphis, Tennessee",2017-08-24,Vancouver X Inn,We selected this hotel for the proximity to airport and ease of getting downtown on the sky train.  The staff was wonderful and so very helpful for our group of 10.  The Sky train was only a couple of blocks from the hotel and a quick 15 minutes from the heart of downtown.  The ride to the airport was only 25 minutes.
175596500,VCBCX1,"Meriden, Connecticut",2013-09-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here for 5 nights the first week of August.  The XT Metrotown is a perfect affordable alternative to comparable hotels in downtown Vancouver.  The hotel was very clean, well kept, and our room on the 9th floor was very quiet.  The lap pool was a great plus for a swimmer, along with a very pleasant outdoor deck area with a small whirlpool.  Very quick and easy access to the SkyTrain, which gets you to downtown Vancouver in 20 minutes.  There is an Asian Mall , Crystal Mall, attached to the hotel, with very strange hours for a large mall, 10;00a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  The much larger Metrotown Mall is about a block down the street.  Self parking is very reasonable and easily accessed from a lobby elevator.  There is a supermarket  right across the street with a great coffee bar with fresh bakery treats."
332816081,VCBCX1,"Mesa, Arizona",2015-12-14,Vancouver X Inn,Great Hotel with easy access to Major Mall and close by Vancouver City and Vancouver Airport. Staff is one of the best XT has to offer. Stayed on Executive floor and both Breakfasts and appetizers were excellent.
464202120,VCBCX1,"Mesa, United States",2017-03-02,Vancouver X Inn,See earlier comments.  The power was off from midnight to 05:30.  No pre-notice at check in online the day before planned outage.  No heat in rooms.  No hot water in morning after power was back on.  Food was horrible in bar.  Manager was rude.
306794334,VCBCX1,"Mexico City, Mexico",2015-09-03,Vancouver X Inn,"You can expect everything to be as it is on XT hotels, it is a very good hotel, the room was great, the breakfast was excellent, service outstanding. The thing is the area around the hotel gets really creepy at night (lonely- creepy) and there were lots of constructions  at that time. I donâ€™t really know Vancouver, but this didnÂ´t seem like a very nice neighborhood.Parking is not free, itâ€™s around 11 CAN per day."
453378291,VCBCX1,"Miami, Florida",2017-01-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Very enjoyable stay at this property.  Hotel property was modern and clean.  Very spacious rooms with excellent view of the city. The staff we encountered were amazing and couldn't have been nicer or more helpful  5 Stars to the employees (with the exception of valet).Multiple options within walking distance for food, drink, shopping and so on.  The feel of being in the middle of the city.   My only complaint was the parking.  They have a parking garage attached to the hotel however about 98% of it is reserved for valet, leaving only about 20 spots for self park.  Hotel clearly is trying to push guest to valet only at a higher cost.  This might not have been so bad but it took forever for someone in valet to come take the car and return it back to us.  If they are going to basically only give you a valet option, then someone needs to light a fire under those valet employees to start providing better service."
288257794,VCBCX1,"Miami, Florida",2015-07-12,Vancouver X Inn,"My wife and I stayed at this XT on the way to a cruise.  The hotel was up to the usual XT standards.  The room was comfortable and clean, the staff was friendly and it had a pretty nice view. .The hotel is somewhat further away from Canada Place, the port that our cruise ship was located at, than I expected.  This was not much of a problem because the Skytrain works very well and it is only two blocks away from the hotel. The hotel is also only two blocks away from the Metrotown Mall , which turned out to be a fun place to shop.Finally, I looked around at prices in hotels near Canada Place and properties of similar qualities were significantly more expensive and many were not available.  I would definitely stay here again."
232171114,VCBCX1,"Miami, Florida",2014-10-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Great hotel.  Friendly staff, clean and spacious rooms, great set-up for breakfast, and safe location.  Across from major Mall.  I think largest in the Vancouver area.  Enjoyed dinner at Catcus Club in walking distance.  Would definitely stay here again."
522070952,VCBCX1,Michigan,2017-09-06,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at this hotel for business. The location was great -- close to a mall and restaurants. There was one minor issue with my room that was fixed immediately. And the staff were very attentive. The restaurant was good, but a little expensive for breakfast. I would stay here again."
295501566,VCBCX1,Middle East,2015-08-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Terrible Executive Lounge which the management don't appear to supervise. Rooms OK. Bar good. Breakfast and restaurant  poor.Good points: Steve in the bar was a barman par excellence- friendly, knowledgeable, helpful. Stephanie on reception was also exceptional. I'm told that a nÅ·ew manager has been appointed who is making good changes - I hope so!Proximity to Skytrain is a bonus."
168922506,VCBCX1,"Middletown, Delaware",2013-07-24,Vancouver X Inn,Recently stayed 7 nights for business. Always enjoy this location. Very close to restaurants and the staff is very attentive. Breakfast buffet is good as are the meals at the in house restaurant. Will stay again!
516143943,VCBCX1,Mill Bay,2017-08-21,Vancouver X Inn,"A great place to stay for a vacation visit, business and shopping! Easy ride in and out of town by skytrain, local facilities are good with Metrotown on the doorstep almost! Ideal to be cose to the bustle of downtown but also sufficiently far away to get away from it when you want to!"
429921545,VCBCX1,"Milwaukie, Oregon",2016-10-19,Vancouver X Inn,"The room was clean, comfortable, and quiet.  As another guest suggested I asked for a room located as high up as possible and away from the ice machine.  The front desk staff was accommodating to my needs and the room service food and personnel were very good."
225188183,VCBCX1,"Minneapolis, United States",2014-08-28,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice and clean. Nice pool on the roof. Located next to the Crystal Mall where I couldn't read 80% of signs. I wish someone had told me about the SkyTrain - driving to downtown was longer and harder than I expected. Wrong location for exploring downtown, but that's my fault, not hotel's."
179276701,VCBCX1,"Mississauga, Canada",2013-09-30,Vancouver X Inn,"I was in town on business for 4 nights, with the wife and son in tow.  I usually stay in Richmond and decided to switch it up this year by staying in Burnaby.  It was very convenient for both business purposes and for our sightseeing excursions.  The front desk staff were amazing, as were housekeeping.  Exiting the parking garage was a little confusing at first but we figured it out.  We had a corner room with amazing mountain view to the north, and nice view to the west as well (except for the neighboring condo building).  Seems antiquated that they charge for internet though.  All in all, mostly satisfied with the stay."
565266436,VCBCX1,"Mississauga, Canada",2018-03-08,Vancouver X Inn,"I have been a XT loyal for years and have watched their decline in the state of their properties. This was is now in the same category I would put Winnipeg XT Airport hotel. Fails on appearance and comfort, is dated and showing it. This area has nothing besides a mall so donâ€™t look for good spots to eat, you wonâ€™t find them. The area is not safe and leaves little room for personal safety.Amenities in the room are hit and miss, my hair dryer melted, no iron and my scenery was a roof. I was moved in the end but wonâ€™t be going back"
354248803,VCBCX1,"Mississauga, Canada",2016-03-09,Vancouver X Inn,Clean hotel with well mannered staff. Slight problem with Internet but resolved by staff. Lack of a store in the lobby as well as complimentary coffee table. The area outside may not feel safest to everyone but I encountered no problems on a early morning walk. Rooms are well appointed.
347043084,VCBCX1,"Mississauga, Canada",2016-02-11,Vancouver X Inn,From front desk to room comfort the entire stay was a great experience. I really enjoyed the room and fitness area was well equipped. Restaurant atmosphere was delightful and staff were very attentive to every need.
357205964,VCBCX1,"Mississauga, Canada",2016-03-20,Vancouver X Inn,Room was dark not enough lights in room. Internet speed even at premium is abysmal. I have noticed that internet speed is a problem at most XT properties. Furniture in room unusable. Bed was great no issues
390607042,VCBCX1,"Missouri City, United States",2016-07-08,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed in a suite which was very spacious and comfortable. The manager was excellent. Upon checking in and getting settled in our room, we discovered the internet was not working and this can be quite tragic when traveling with your teenage son!. The manager personally came to our room, investigated, call the help contact # and determined there was an outage in our section of the hotel. He provided us the ability to connect to the internet via wire in lieu of wireless. Excellent customer service."
274483312,VCBCX1,"Montreal, Canada",2015-05-25,Vancouver X Inn,"I was here for 5 days for business and I was upgraded to a suite.Been that many days at the hotel, i really appreciated having the extra room which was like a living room completely separated from the bedroom. Every night I ate at the hotel with room service cause too tired to go out. Each night I had a different meal and each and every one was seriously amazing, way better tan what could be normally expected from a &quot;normal hotel restaurant&quot;. This hotel even though it is not located in the city center, hence no ocean views, it is a great value."
434970020,VCBCX1,"Montreal, Canada",2016-11-05,Vancouver X Inn,"I really enjoyed my stay at the XT Metrotown Vancouver. I have been there more than once and the quality of the service, room is absolutely great for the value. The personnel is exceptional and they make everything in their power to ensure that your stay is as comfortable as can be. The quality of the food is excellent and more than once did they accommodate my special requests. This is my home away from home in Vancouver."
173856273,VCBCX1,"Montreal, Canada",2013-08-24,Vancouver X Inn,"I travel all over the country and this is my favorite hotel in Canada.  The hotel is centrally located and easy to get to from the airport, the rooms are great, the staff is super helpfull and friendly and really know how to make you feel at home.  Over the last 3  years, I have probably stayed here for about 45 nights.  Same impecable service every time.  If only I could get this level of service in other hotels......."
179545702,VCBCX1,"Montreal, Canada",2013-10-02,Vancouver X Inn,"This Hotel is a &quot;Home away from Home&quot; with its safe, warm, caring environment and its stable staff that remembers your wine and coffee preference. Management is very attentive to client requests. Although located at walking distance from the sky train, the rooms are quiet enough to let you enjoy beautiful mountain views."

They put me in another room but that cause me some problem and i had to switch room next day. Fortunately, i didn't had to pay for the first night. Staff was great."
573317767,VCBCX1,"Montreal, Canada",2018-04-14,Vancouver X Inn,"Easy to get to from the airport. Underground parking. Staff at front desk always welcoming. Rooms with view of Grouse mountain.

526824540,VCBCX1,"Montreal, Canada",2017-09-23,Vancouver X Inn,"I really like this hotel. They have the Executive Lounge on the top floor with a gorgeous view. Front desk staff are always patient and understanding, even when I'm really tired. Rooms are great and beds very comfy. "
409034386,VCBCX1,"Monument, CO, United States",2016-08-22,Vancouver X Inn,"We used our XT points to stay here. Although it is not really close to downtown Vancouver, it is less than a block to the translink station and a very easy train ride to downtown Vancouver. Very nice hotel adjacent to a very large mall. Nice amenities."
296951877,VCBCX1,"Moorestown, New Jersey",2015-08-08,Vancouver X Inn,"We ended our 2 week trip at Vancouver. The hotel is excellent. The staff is helpful. Though easy to get to downtown by train, we drove and that was a hassle at times. It is about 6 miles from the city. The views from the hotel is nice. The malls closely were a good place for some quick shopping. "
344427183,VCBCX1,"Moose Jaw, Canada",2016-02-01,Vancouver X Inn,Exceptional service and staff!!!! VERY friendly and helpful!!!  Great room with a beautiful view!!!!  Will recommend this hotel!!!  The food was great as well!!!  Very comfy beds!!!  We had a beautiful view of the mountains as well!!!  The staff was very courteous and friendly and helped us out allot!!
288073341,VCBCX1,"mossbank, Canada",2015-07-11,Vancouver X Inn,I would expect more upscale hotel for the price of our stay. The staff were pleasant and helpful and we had a young waiter that served us breakfast every morning that was an excellent employee and he was that best part of our stay.
230490956,VCBCX1,"Mount Juliet, Tennessee",2014-09-23,Vancouver X Inn,We arrived in BC a few days prior to our cruise leaving. The view of the area are breathtaking. The hotel was a typical XT. The staff was gracious and professional. Near good dining and lots of fun sights to see.  This is a place I would come back to in the future.
215841412,VCBCX1,"Mount Laurel, United States",2014-07-16,Vancouver X Inn,Was in Vancouver for two nights and was extremely pleased with the hotel's service and overall experience.  Hotel is about a five minute walk to the transit system which made everything within reach.  Would highly recommend this hotel.
402570089,VCBCX1,"Mount Vernon, Washington",2016-08-07,Vancouver X Inn,We wanted to get away for a family vacation and we decided to go to Vancouver BC.  We stayed on the 17th floor.  I agree with the recommendations of others of staying on the executive floor is where it is at.  Great view and free breakfast.  You have Price mart to get all your groceries a block away and the metro town mall where you can shop to your hearts content with three different levels.  The metro town hotel was great and the customer service was excellent especially a staff member named Leonora who helped us with reservations.  You will have to pay for parking but you can take the sky train everywhere which is also a block away. 
314160238,VCBCX1,"Mountain View, California",2015-09-27,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is opposite the building site for the future mall, so be careful while walking around. The heating system is so noisy that I could sleep even with earplugs. Being Gold member I expect free breakfast, yet I was told to pay extra for scrambled eggs, as it is not part of continental breakfast. Really? Have management or this hotel even been to any other place including other XTs? On the other side, location is not bad, close to the train and rooms are of a good size and well looked after. "
368453067,VCBCX1,"Mountlake Terrace, Washington",2016-04-28,Vancouver X Inn,I book mine online that has free breakfast but apparently it's only for platinum member . Internet is not free too. You have to be a member to access . This deal is okay if you're a local but would be great for tourist like us. I thought I'll be saving since I'm a member but i could stay in another hotel w free breakfast and Internet at the same quality hotel and rate .
205871260,VCBCX1,"Munich, Germany",2014-05-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed there for 2 days. I offers the standard XT service, but to be honest for the price of around 190 Dollar I expected more. It is the little things that count when you are travelling for many days. E.g. elevator was always overloaded. Internet is not free, no complimentary water for XT gold card members, shower was rinning poorly, no international TV channels, fitness centre just offer 2 threadmills and a few mattresses + weights. Area is ok, close to shopping district and seminar place is ok. Summarized the hotel is ok, but it is much far away from outperforming. I did expect a little bit more for that price."
402280378,VCBCX1,"N. Attleboro, United States",2016-08-06,Vancouver X Inn,The location of this hotel is excellent.  Access to the SkyTrain to get downtown makes this property an alternative to staying in the city.  Hotel has a fair rate for overnight parking.  Guest rooms meet meet XT standards.  Pool is only a lap pool but you have got to remember that we are in Canada.  Nice to be close to shopping at the Mall next door.  Hotel does have a a good happy hour if one chooses or can take advantage of it.
289723023,VCBCX1,"Nairobi, Kenya",2015-07-14,Vancouver X Inn,A Warm greeting at the reception and a map with directions showing sites to visit made my stay in the Vancouver worthwhile. A let down was that breakfast was not included as part of the price charged.
481139978,VCBCX1,Nanaimo BC,2017-05-02,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel location was great, the room was huge, the staff friendly. Great for families.  Team dinner was held and the staff was great, the food amazing, the overall experience was perfect. We had several families staying and everyone had a good time and comfortable stay. Quick walk to Starbucks,  Boston Pizza and Metrotown mall. Grocery stores nearby."
583204355,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2018-05-27,Vancouver X Inn,"I always try to stay at the XT Vancouver Metrotown during my routine business visits to Burnaby.  The staff are friendly, and I really appreciate the location and the room sizes.  The lounge is okay - decent cocktails, but the food selections there and in the restaurant are a little pricey for the quality.  Luckily, there are many great options nearby.I don't love having to swipe my key or phone to get the elevators to work - the added security is nice, but it seems unnecessary given the neighborhood and front desk staff.  The bedside clock is also super bright - I generally just unplug the thing, since my phone is my primary alarm anyway.A highlight is always the front desk staff.  Maybe it's how they're managed, or maybe it's their team make up, but they are a great, friendly group who always seem genuinely glad to see me back."
157650880,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2013-04-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Albeit this hotel was comfortable and the staff were awesome, the lap pool was closed (bummer #1) ... If I hadn't asked the front desk about other amenities I wouldn't have know the hot tub was still open.  XT is cheeping out on its in room coffee -I personally think this is a horrible place to cut back on.  My morning coffee is very important and their in room coffee was weak -to put it mildly. (bummer #2) Free WiFi in the lobby but you are charged for it in your room -bunk! .... only word that comes to mind. (bummer #3).  other than awesome staff, the one real redeeming quality was the breakfast being served -it was excellent!!!!!"
149802176,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2013-01-16,Vancouver X Inn,"My husband stays at this hotel on business several times during the year.  I joined him on a trip to Vancouver in November 2012.  Our room was spacious and comfortable with a great view of the city.  We had dinner in the restaurant, delicious food and wonderful service.  We also enjoyed cocktails in the bar.  Friendly staff and prompt service.  The proximity to Metrotown Mall is fabulous.  I got so much Christmas shopping done over the three days we were there.."
537311166,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2017-10-30,Vancouver X Inn,"Staff were pleasant and helpful, no complaints.  Roof was clean and tidy.  In spite of being downtown in a busy area, we found the room to be quiet and isolated from traffic noise.  No evaluation on pool, looked nice but was outside.  Refrigerator in Room was a plus, bed was comfortable and Wi'fi was consistent."
189094385,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2013-12-30,Vancouver X Inn,"If not essential to stay in downtown Vancouver, the XT Metrotown is a short 20 minute trip via public transit on the overhead Skytrain system away. It is regularly half the price of similar downtown hotels and is centrally located near shopping and access to other town centres in the Lower Mainland."
312921805,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2015-09-22,Vancouver X Inn,"Always polite, not smarmy, and alway prom to solve your problem, or directions. I pay for a extra XT stay because the rooms are clean, and the locations are in line with peoples trips. Even my stays at XTs from my road trips Vancouver to Toronto trips via the US have been a great experience."
236929494,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2014-10-29,Vancouver X Inn,We have stayed at this hotel twice now for three to four nights each time. We have never received such outstanding service as we have at the XT Metrotown. The staff are extremely courteous and helpful and the rooms are very comfortable. Will be coming back to this hotel for years to come. 
342503508,VCBCX1,"NANAIMO, Canada",2016-01-24,Vancouver X Inn,"Hands down, best in the city, from arrival to departure, everyone on staff is so friendly and welcoming!

575958915,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2018-04-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Superb location, right in the middle of shopping areas, attached to really interesting (primarily Chinese) mall offering exotic foods.  Rooms are usual XT quality, excellent staff. Not cheap, but generally good value for an urban property. "
450251070,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2017-01-07,Vancouver X Inn,Great service! Nice rooms! Good food! The only downside was paying for wifi. We would reccomend this hotel! We loved that it was adjacent to Metropolis! We also found delicious dimsum nearby. A great start to new year!
371463272,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2016-05-09,Vancouver X Inn,"Over all stay was good, staff was freindly and helpful. Rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Close to metrotown and lots of restaurants in the area to choose from. For the price i found the room just ok."
373543984,VCBCX1,"Nanaimo, Canada",2016-05-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Great service, easy check in and beautiful location in Burnaby. Conveniently close to metrotown. Great pool, spa and gym location. Clean and spotless rooms. Quick and easy drive from highway 1 to the hotel."
229350002,VCBCX1,"nanoose bay, bc",2014-09-16,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a super good hotel choice if you are attending a concert at Deer Lake Park. The hotel has a decent lounge that is open late, and was well used. Rooms are average for a larger hotel chain. They could use a splash of updating, and maybe to redo the bathrooms. Price was good, so it is a fair choice. Did not use any of the other ammenities. They did charge for underground parking. And wi-fi if you needed it, was only free in the lobby."
369846770,VCBCX1,"Nashville, Tennessee",2016-05-03,Vancouver X Inn,This was a great property...complete with a super staff.  (Big thanks to Stephanie on the front desk.) The room was clean and plush. The exec lounge was well run...good lite food fare. Price was wonderful. Look forward to being back.
382065593,VCBCX1,Nelson,2016-06-12,Vancouver X Inn,"Cleanest hotel, excellent service and great amenities.  Across the street from BC's largest shopping and entertainment centre.  Easy skytrain travel from airport and to downtown Vancouver.  Parking underground."
502023337,VCBCX1,"New Braunfels, Texas",2017-07-14,Vancouver X Inn,"By XT standards this hotel is a bit dated.  The beds are overly firm and the seating in the room is limited to a desk chair and an armless chair with foot stool.  A love seat or large armed chair would go a long way.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the housekeeping was quite good.  The restaurant is weak ... we dined there twice.  The restaurant staff is good, but the food is just okay.  Parking is combined with the adjacent mall and is plentiful.  The neighborhood is somewhat rundown, but seems to be on the upswing with lots of new buildings going up."
615380142,VCBCX1,"New Brunswick, Canada",2018-09-10,Vancouver X Inn,"I give this property top marks for location as itâ€™s a short walk to the train (20 min downtown, direct), across from a shopping area and thereâ€™s a few restaurants nearby. The room was sufficient and Iâ€™ve seen nicer at other XTâ€™s. The staff was friendly. The price was what youâ€™d expect for the area."
352491740,VCBCX1,New Jersey,2016-03-02,Vancouver X Inn,"So conveniently located, a few short blocks to the train. Spacious room. We stayed here and took the train to Vancouver each day.  Trains were frequent, on time, and clean.Not much to do at the hotel. A park next to the hotel is nice and clean."
324041378,VCBCX1,"New Westminster, Canada",2015-11-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Only WiFi for up to 3 devices or else they charge $10. The pool is very small and thin, like a lane but it is rooftop! There's also a tiny hot tub and a kids pool. The hotel is attached to an Asian strip market. Metrotown very close just a short walk. Nice clean rooms, no complimentary breakfast unless you are a diamond member or staying on the top two floors. Then you can eat in the Opal Lounge for breakfast and evening appetizers. Probably shouldn't say this but our room key malfunctioned and gave us access to the Opal Lounge even though we were staying on the fifth floor lol. So we enjoyed some free food we just had to act like we were rich and we had no issues so if you're staying here, try and see if your room card will open the lounge door on the 18th floor. Overall we had fun but one of the staff members was rude. No problems though, it was good."
520870232,VCBCX1,"New Westminster, Canada",2017-09-03,Vancouver X Inn,Celebrated our anniversary with a last minute stay and buffet breakfast. It was a great treat! The room was perfect. King size suite. Very clean and we enjoyed the breakfast buffet. The staff was very accommodating when we inquired about checking in earlier. And it was also my first time booking through the XT app. Very user friendly and easy to check in.
394161724,VCBCX1,"New Westminster, Canada",2016-07-18,Vancouver X Inn,"Good beds, a good place to stay with family and business. The best is the location, pretty close to Metropolis Mall and Kingsway St. which if full of restaurants and places to go out and also a sky train station and bus stations. The staff is very careful and always pay attention to the guests!"
495466921,VCBCX1,new york,2017-06-23,Vancouver X Inn,"If you can't stay downtown, or don't want to, this is a nice option.  Rooms are pretty spacious, good climate control, nice TV and wifi worked well.  Bathrooms a little odd, seem dated but were totally fine.  The hotel is attached to a rather depressing small mall with lots of closed shops.  There's a big dim sum place in there, just average.  5 minute walk to the Skytrain and you can get downtown conveniently."
390876002,VCBCX1,"New York City, New York",2016-07-09,Vancouver X Inn,"I'm unfamiliar with Vancouver, and thought this location was a little too far from the city's attractions to warrant such a high price.  But it was close to mass transit, so we were able to get downtown with a little advance planning.  We stayed on the executive level and had access to the lounge, which was really nice. The evening &quot;cocktail hours&quot; and breakfasts were wonderful.  The one complaint we had was addressed during our stay.  The previous guest(s) had clearly been smoking, and the room smelled of cigarettes. They offered to move us to a different room, but we wanted to stay on the executive level. So they sent up an ionizer to help remove the odor, and that worked well enough.  The staff was incredibly accommodating and genuinely wanted to make things right, and we really appreciated that.  I would highly recommend this hotel for someone looking for a nice place to stay in the Vancouver area."
552783271,VCBCX1,"New York City, New York",2018-01-09,Vancouver X Inn,"I was hesitant to stay outside of Downtown Vancouver when I booked Metrotown. I have never been in this area before, but the reviews said it was conveniently located next to the largest mall so I said what the heck.  Over our 5 day stay, I didn't step foot in the mall. LOL! We didn't need to.  There is so many things around the hotel in walking distance. We did nightly 2-1/2 hour foot and body massages at Yuen Foot Spa. It's a few blocks down the street. Highly recommend. The Metro is right down the street so for $2.85CAD, you can take a quick trip to various spots in Downton Vancouver, like the Waterfront and Gastown. So easy, I was amazed! Parking at the hotel is really low too.  Only $16/night as compared to $30-$40/night in Downtown properties.  We already booked our stay for our next trip to Vancouver!!!"
185615428,VCBCX1,"New York City, New York",2013-11-23,Vancouver X Inn,"We enjoyed our stay at this XT, where we were (happily) upgraded to a suite.  There were views of the mountains all around - it was lovely!  The service in the bar/restaurant was very nice.  The hotel is not located downtown on the waterfront like some of the others we considered, but that's probably why the price was much more reasonable.  It's attached to a small mall that is entirely full of Chinese stores and products, which we found fun and interesting.  It's only a few blocks from the skytrain, and there is a very large mall only a few blocks away as well.  The non-central location worked quite well for us, though it would have been nice to have had access to more good restaurants.  All in all, quite a good place."
289519705,VCBCX1,"New York City, New York",2015-07-16,Vancouver X Inn,"This XT like most, has decent rooms, the staff were friendly enough.  The lobby is drab, lifeless, and boring.  Metrotown is an area in flux.  It's still a little sketchy but undergoing gentrification.  All in all its a fairly boring XT, but in that a good choice."
282938547,VCBCX1,"New York City, New York",2015-06-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent property, Centrally located in Metrotown. One of the cleanest XTs I've ever stayed. Great Staff and top of the line accomodations. Located above the Crystal Mall..If you love Chinese food this is the place to be"
288351482,VCBCX1,"New York City, New York",2015-07-12,Vancouver X Inn,"Location is not bad since this location avoids bad traffic during rush hour, but still has access to the train.  The hotel staff was courteous, service was good.  Room service was good as well.  Overall a pleasant stay."
268416344,VCBCX1,"Newcastle, Australia",2015-04-27,Vancouver X Inn,"After planning a one week stay at the XT Vancouver Metrotown, we needed to check in 3 days early. Hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful in organising everything for our change in plans. The suite was fantastic with a view over the city of Burnaby out towards Vancouver harbour. The hotel is located close to both Metrotown (largest shopping centre in Vancouver) as well as the sky train which connects you to most places in the city."
152854866,VCBCX1,"Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada",2013-02-23,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at this hotel when an unexpected trip arose. The service was excellent. Staff were exceptionally accommodating and very helpful in all regards. The hotel is located in a very convenient location. The room was spacious, well appointed, clean, and well tended to. I will stay here again."
487195976,VCBCX1,"Newman Lake, Washington",2017-05-23,Vancouver X Inn,I have stayed here every week for a month and I would recommend it to anyone.  The staff is great and very friendly! Steve is a bartender on the weekends and he is awesome!  Knows of some great places to visit and makes awesome drinks! The rooms are great but request a mountain view.  The best is the 18th floor. 
252571457,VCBCX1,"Niagara Falls, Canada",2015-02-04,Vancouver X Inn,"The Pro's:  Overall a nice hotel.  Rooms are clean, beds are comfortable.  There is a restaurant on-site, it's convenient but expensive for what you get.  Hotel is located close to shopping and the Sky Train.The Con's:  the on-site gym is very small and cramped, undersized for an 18-storey hotel.  The WiFi is virtually unusable.  I stayed on business, and attempting to get caught up on work using the hotel WiFi was pointless.  Email and web browsing is horribly slow.  Don't even bother trying to participate in a Webex or GoToMeeting session.  Want to FaceTime your family back home?  Use LTE instead.  I wound up leaving the hotel and using the free Wifi at Starbucks.  The Verdict:  If you are looking for a clean room with basic amenities, then the XT Metrotown is for you.  If you want luxuries like usable WiFi, you are better served by Hyatt or Sheraton."
212056261,VCBCX1,"North Potomac, Maryland",2014-06-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed for over a week.  The hotel is nice, clean, and the staff is very friendly.  The entire city of Vancouver is very expensive.  The hotel is near a very large shopping mall, and actually attached to a smaller shopping mall that has mostly asian ethnic stores and restaurants.  The hotel is a few blocks from the Skytrain station.  The outdoor pool and hot-tub are heated and have a great view of the mountains.  The staff at the restaurant were superb, and the breakfast buffet was more than adequate, and, although, not included with the price of the stay, was a nice add-on for not so much money (for Vancouver)"
217913117,VCBCX1,North Saanich,2014-07-27,Vancouver X Inn,"Very friendly professional reception, great rooms, vey quiet, fantastic Sunday Brunch which was worth the trip on its own! Will always stay here as my &quot;Stay of Choice&quot; whenever I will be in the Vancouver area."
265657524,VCBCX1,North Vancouver,2015-04-14,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed there for a night recently. The view from the room was not spectacular, but the staff were good and very attentive. We may or may not go again, as its a very crowded and congested part of Burnaby."
186023748,VCBCX1,"North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",2013-11-26,Vancouver X Inn,I was there for a conference Friday to Sunday. The staff is top notch and the room spotless. The food and drinks were exceptional. Friday night was a social and the finger food was tasty and there was even a chef preparing dishes as we ate. Saturday night buffet was like the usual buffets but salads were unique and the prime rib excellent. Sorry to sound so excited about it but I left on Sunday saying this place hit a home run
456776902,VCBCX1,"North Vancouver, Canada",2017-02-02,Vancouver X Inn,"The location is fantastic for shopping at Metrotown Mall and there are many great restaurants around the area. THe hotel Restaurant Reflect has great food and service, the Chef even comes out to speak to you, now where do you find that.  Housekeeping never walked past us without a greeting and warm smile.  I attended a meeting there and the Banquer staff were very responsive.  My booking was handled professionally and in time no question unanswered with many different options to choose from.  Front desk staff gave my husband many activities of the area while I attended my meeting.  great Job XT Vancouver Metrotown team members, you should be proud."
355126641,VCBCX1,"North Vancouver, Canada",2016-03-13,Vancouver X Inn,"I've stayed at this hotel several times as its located in a very central area with excellent links to transport.  The hotel staff are very helpful, the rooms are comfortable (although some can be a little on the small side) and there are excellent facilities on the door step.There are some fabulous views of Downtown Vancouver, the North Shore mountains and on a clear day, you can even see Mount Baker."
319101437,VCBCX1,"North Vancouver, Canada",2015-10-15,Vancouver X Inn,"I attended an all-day workshop with Lyoness on August 15 and the service was wonderful - from the valet who parked my car up to the banquet floor and catering staff.  This property has special meaning to me as I was part of the opening sales team back in 1999...wow, hey?Great location.  Great staff.  Thoughtful customer service and amenities for your next business sessions."
169838663,VCBCX1,nyc,2013-07-29,Vancouver X Inn,"It is in the middle of everything like shopping. It is next to the biggest mall in Canada. The hotel was very clean. The staff are very accommodating.The down size it is conected to this mall and I found it that anyone can come and go through the entrance that connects the hotel and the mall.There should be a secured entrance, like a door that only hotel guest can access to."
390999058,VCBCX1,"Oakland, California",2016-07-10,Vancouver X Inn,Stayed in this hotel because all downtown hotels were full. It has access to nearby skytrain and to a 400 store shopping mall. The skytrain will take you to downtown in 20 min for less than 3$. The hotel was average- no big complains. Staff was friendly.
500599998,VCBCX1,"Oakville, Canada",2017-07-10,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is centrally located next to Sky Train which make for easy access to downtown and other locations. BUT the real reason for the high rating is the awesome staff who will go out of their way for you. From the front desk staff, the people working the executive lounge to housekeeping. Oh and let's not forget the killer high speed internet access. They made our Canada Day stay amazing."
517712407,VCBCX1,"Ojai, California",2017-08-26,Vancouver X Inn,"This is an excellent XT property, in a great location.  The building is fairly modern.  And the rooms are spacious, quiet and very clean.  The high floor rooms have dramatic city and mountain views.  The staff at the front desk are in the game, checking you in or out with minimal fuss.  Parking is underground and reasonably priced.  The surrounding area is saturated with reasonably priced restaurants of every persuasion.  There is a large park within 1/2 mile or so that has miles of splendid, wooded walking trails.  You can go 'forest bathing' for free. The SkyTrain light rail is a very short walk from the hotel and gives fast, inexpensive, clean and easy access to greater Vancouver.  We would be delighted to return to this XT property-over and over again."
463108814,VCBCX1,"Okanagan Falls, Canada",2017-02-26,Vancouver X Inn,Stayed there on a weekend for the first time using my XT points. Service of staff is excellent. Always cheerful and accommodating. I don't like the fact they charge for parking. Parkade is shared with strip mall and is quite conjested
199104941,VCBCX1,"Okanagan, Canada",2014-03-28,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at this hotel in Burnaby to be near friends.  It is right next door to Metrotown mall.  Easy walking distance.  It is also connected to Crystal Mall for excellent Asian food.  Don't pass up this cultural experience!   The breakfast buffet is excellent.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Fitness room is great.  Wifi works great except you need to sign in everyday but no big deal. If you have a car, this is a great XT hotel to stay at."
353448298,VCBCX1,"Olympia, Washington",2016-03-06,Vancouver X Inn,"I have stayed here 5 times over the past 3 years. I love the location when my business brings me to the Burnaby part of the GVA. The hotel is clean, the rooms are adequately furnished and the hotel staff is always friendly and willing to lend a hand. The only hassle is finding parking underground after hours or during mid-day shopping since the hotel shares parking with the nearby mall. Otherwise, if your travels take you to Burnaby, be sure to check out XT Vancouver Metrotown!"
209342785,VCBCX1,"Omaha, Nebraska",2014-06-07,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed on vacation. Great location just outside of the Vancouver city limits with quick access to all major roads. Was the perfect location for our sightseeing adventure. One recent review complained about $ for parking and internet; I've never stayed in a big city where those weren't charged for. The fees were reasonable considering what I've paid in eastern US cities. Morning views of the city and mountains were wonderful. If you have access to the top floor breakfast and happy hour, they are worth the charge (being a XT owner,it was included in my charges). The Crystal City Mall area was very interesting, lots of very good restaurants in the area. The metro sky-train is only a block a way. The staff was excellent in their treatment of all guests. I only had one complaint and it was dealt with swiftly. If I return to Vancouver, I will definitely stay here. Wife is getting used to staff getting our tough sounding last name right."
150368879,VCBCX1,Ontario,2013-01-23,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel location is easily accessible and is adjacent to Vancouver's biggest mall, Metrotown.  I have been staying there for years and am always impressed with the level of service I receive each and every time.  The rooms are very modern and all amenities are readily available.  Aside from the great location and great service, it is very affordable."
391563359,VCBCX1,"Ontario, Canada",2016-07-11,Vancouver X Inn,XT inn Metrotown Vancouver the hotel is not to bad. I am a gold member and was not offered a upgrade. Also used valet parking and paid good money for it and the valet service damage my vehicle and did not tell me. I was not very impressed with that service.
211559972,VCBCX1,"Orange County,  CA",2014-06-22,Vancouver X Inn,"Perfect location.  Just a sky train from downtown Vancouver.  Hotel staff is very accommodating.  Restaurant and Bar food is excellent.  You can book any day trips with the Valet. Great area!  walk to shops, restaurants and the Massive Metrotown Mall is down just a block.  I would definitely stay here again.  This hotel is the reason I only stay at XTs!"
642739369,VCBCX1,"Orange County, California",2018-12-31,Vancouver X Inn,"STAFF: friendly, attentive, helpful staff"
518647822,VCBCX1,"Oregon City, United States",2017-08-28,Vancouver X Inn,"Loved this hotel, great rooms, view and restaurant! We ate at the rooftop restaurant for dinner and for breakfast. Took the Skytrain downtown to catch a SeaBus over to North Vancouver. Visited Stanley Park, Grouse Mtn. Enjoyed a great breakfast and service off the menu. Ordered room service (great pizza and cake!), and enjoyed the super comfy bed, internet access and the corner room view!"
177456051,VCBCX1,"Orlando, Florida",2013-09-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here for two night before our Alaskan Cruise.  It is 20 minutes to the Cruiseline terminals. The Asian mall attached to the hotel was interesting, we tried to go eat there but nothing was in English.  Went to the Metropolis mall which is 5 minutes away walking.  The parking was underneath the building and it is shared with the Asian mall, very tight down there be careful.  Room and service were very good.  We ordered room service twice and it was good and the server was attentive.  Clean, large room.  Too bad in a few months you will only be able to see more buildings out of the window.  Overall very good."
452940789,VCBCX1,"Orlando, United States",2017-01-16,Vancouver X Inn,"If you are looking for a hotel that offers great quality, service, and location to downtown Vancouver and attractions this property is a must! My wife and I enjoy our stay and it is a must to do the Sunday brunch!!!"
345370609,VCBCX1,Ottawa,2016-02-06,Vancouver X Inn,First the positive: the service at his location was excellent. 
229361805,VCBCX1,"Ottawa, Canada",2014-09-16,Vancouver X Inn,Good quality for the money at government rate. Rates are variable and seem to change often (at least on-line) so make sure you are booking at the best rate possible; call if unsure. Wi-Fi is not included in the room rate!
421827156,VCBCX1,"Ottawa, Canada",2016-09-24,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is well located outside of Vancouver. Only 20 minutes from downton by skytrain. Great hotel, friendly staff, the room  was wonderful. The breakfast was very good and fresh. I would stay there again"
259104066,VCBCX1,"Overland Park, Kansas, United States",2015-03-12,Vancouver X Inn,"I didn't spend much time here, but the room was comfortable. The staff was friendly and it was easy to get a cab. There were plenty of places to eat around there. I found it to be similar to US based XT's and would stay here again."
587298916,VCBCX1,"Palm City, Florida",2018-06-13,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel is excellent for business travelers as well.  Clean and comfortable. Hotel and restaurant staff wonderful and the food was great!  Close to Metro. We had s great stay at the XT Metrotown. 
231660213,VCBCX1,"Palmdale, California",2014-09-29,Vancouver X Inn,"This was my return visit and it was just as good as the first.  I would liked to have rated it as a 5 but as I didn't eat at the restaurant or use the gym facilities I felt I didn't have a complete picture.  I had a lovely room on the 16th Floor with beautiful views of Vancouver and the mountains.  The staff in the check-in were great as was the bell staff at the entrance to the hotel.  I had access to the Executive Lounge where they had a great choice of evening appetizers, drinks and deserts.  Plus in the morning it has a range of breakfast items. The lounge is not huge but seems to cope with the number of guests using it.  The staff member looking after the facility was really attentive to your needs.  It was great to relax there after the journey, enjoy a drink and take in the magnificent views.  My room was really quiet and I had a wonderful nights sleep in the very comfortable bed.  I will be back again :)"
593893304,VCBCX1,"Palmdale, California",2018-07-07,Vancouver X Inn,Great service and friendly staff. Comfortable room and amenities. Location was convenient and close to a mall in a safe neighborhood. The hotel was also close to the Skytrain. There is a fridge in the room and the bed was very comfortable. 
524234124,VCBCX1,"Palo Alto, California",2017-09-13,Vancouver X Inn,"The bad: poor checking in experience with a NOC shift guy who knew little about hospitality. Small suite and the executive lounge is not as good as our previous experiences in other XT Hotels. Milk in the espresso machine was awful. Bad hot sweaty stench in the top floor that never really went away despite staff assurances. Questionable neighborhood. It has a third world feel to it. Parking garage is difficult to navigate especially to exit due to tight places and other business share it hence lots of  exit traffic during the day.The good: it's quiet, comfortable beds, and good BBQ restaurant experience and most of the staff are friendly."
493885687,VCBCX1,"Panama City, United States",2017-06-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Very alarmed when I pulled up to this location...exterior looked old and ran down...Personnel did not look the normal XT professional...interior of lobby, halls, elevator, etc ran down and very dirty...room size was good...King suite...furniture was in very bad condition...literally frayed and torn...did not feel comfortable sitting on furniture...bathroom was dated but appeared clean and functional"
507615663,VCBCX1,"Papamoa, New Zealand",2017-07-31,Vancouver X Inn,Having just stay in New York for 3 nights with my daughter we arrived at the hotel and booked into our room which had this amazing view out over the entrance to the harbour. Our room was well appointed and lovely white towels all fluffy were just to inviting not to have a shower and rid myself of the travel tiredness.We went down into the lobby  and familiarised ourselves with the layout and restaurants. We decided to eat out as it was our first time in Canada and want to experience the streets and local food.This hotel lived up to its standard that any XT in the world has and certain can recommend a revisit stay.
195522318,VCBCX1,"Paris, Canada",2014-02-26,Vancouver X Inn,I found the service at this hotel beyond compare.  The bellmen and valet parking staff were the best I've ever encountered anywhere.  Always a smile and a helping hand.  Unbelievable.  Food in hotel restaurant was very good.  Don't know why wine fridges in all rooms instead of real fridges but a real fridge was brought to my room upon request.  Front desk staff very friendly and always available to help with directions.  Rooms clean and fresh and the best pillows of any hotel I've ever stayed in.  Very impressed all in all.
235602835,VCBCX1,"Parksville, Canada",2014-10-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Very impressed with this property from start to finish!!  Reservations were seamless, efficient and I had a confirmation within moments of my booking.  Leah was great on the phone.  We were able to access our room earlier than the scheduled checkin time and the staff on the front end were extremely personable and knowledgeable.  The valet and bellman service provide by Josef and Ronaldo was outstanding!  We were on the 15th floor with a great city view and everything in the room one could possibly need.  We enjoyed the rooftop hot tub and pool and the very comfortable quarters.  We only had one night as were attending an event, but we could stay a week no problem!  Great job XT Team!!  We hope to come back and see you again soon."
209835744,VCBCX1,"Parksville, Canada",2014-06-10,Vancouver X Inn,"My daughter and I spent one night at this hotel and were excited at the prospect of staying at a XT hotel!  However when we arrived the staff were unhelpful and rude, the room was small and unattractive, and I cannot believe that in this day and age there was an $8 charge for wi-fi!  Even budget hotels at half the price have free wi-fi!  I will never again stay at a XT hotel.  It is not worth the reputation that it has and this particular hotel was greatly over-priced considering the accommodation."
468716244,VCBCX1,"Parksville, Canada",2017-03-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Just finished our Fall buying trip for shoes and as usual, this was at the XT...wonderful choice, to be able to stay where I need to view next seasons selections. The hotel and staff, always, were helpful and our suite was tidy, clean and very comfortable...the Executive Lounge was truly enjoyable both after a long day and for breakfast at the start of our day!"
316957699,VCBCX1,"Parksville, Canada",2015-10-07,Vancouver X Inn,"Cheaper than the downtown XT but easy commute. All you expect from a XT, helpful staff, clean rooms and good towels ! Tip :- get Valet Parking, it's worth the extra few dollars, the car park is shared with the shopping mall, can be a zoo to park."
525319242,VCBCX1,"Patchogue, New York",2017-09-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Wonderful hotel located in downtown Burnaby. Close to all you ever would want to do there. Friendly staff, very helpful, guest rooms are excellent. Breakfast was just fine! Would go back again the next time I'm in the area."
254611901,VCBCX1,"Peachland, Canada",2015-02-16,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff at this hotel are kind and caring. The rooms are quiet with comfortable beds and lovely linens. If you are around at dinner, I highly recommend the Reflections dining room. Sky train service is a block away and cabs to the airport are reasonable. I have to include, it is right beside one of the best shopping malls in the lower mainland."
456061252,VCBCX1,"Pemberton, Canada",2017-01-30,Vancouver X Inn,"Great team, good location, well maintained facilities. A number of frontline staff have been here for a while, an indication of a good culture. Highly recommend this location for this part of vancouver.Gym/fitness center is ok, however there is access to an offsite facility close by if you require more substantial equipment."
366862469,VCBCX1,"Pennington, New Jersey",2016-04-24,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel is not downtown Vancouver so be prepared to have to travel around to see Vancouver but we knew this in advance. The hotel is comfortable but rooms could do with updating. The staff were helpful and friendly which for me always makes a difference. I used the gym but it is extremely small and not especially well equipped. Overall this is an average XT with nothing especially good or bad to recommend it.
225391385,VCBCX1,"penticton, Canada",2014-08-29,Vancouver X Inn,"Central location, very close to very large mall, skytrain and Vancouver, room with view was clean and the beds were very comfortable.  The staff service was phenomenal.  Buffet breakfast included but ask for the other items that you can choose which are omelettes, eggs benedict, etc.  I highly recommend this hotel."
296899286,VCBCX1,"Perth, Australia",2015-08-08,Vancouver X Inn,"we booked through Expedia paid  AUD $190.00 per night, King Bed, no breakfast. Location is great, easy walk to large shopping center Metro-town, Sky Train and restaurants. Staff were friendly and helpful, our room on 4th floor seems a little dated only 1 little glitch the shower curtain did not keep all the water in the shower, we had plenty of towels so no drama. Free Wifi was good too. Friends stayed in an executive room that includes breakfast and afternoon tea will definitely consider that next time. Hubby and I shared 1 breakfast in our room ordered an additional egg, reasonable at 18 CAD plus egg, it was delicious and more than enough."
568147362,VCBCX1,"Pfafftown, North Carolina",2018-03-22,Vancouver X Inn,"No surprises, clean comfortable. Friendly staff, good amenities. Good fitness equipment, room service fast and friendly, food is good.  Convenient location and parking is uncomplicated. Easy check in check out services. "
263183837,VCBCX1,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",2015-04-01,Vancouver X Inn,While located about 20 minutes out of the city (which was not optimal) this hotel proved to be an excellent choice particularly due to the staff.  Friendly and professional the staff gladly accommodated all of our questions and needs.  The surrounding places to eat were not great.
391820377,VCBCX1,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",2016-07-12,Vancouver X Inn,"Metrotown XT is about 30 minutes from down town Vancouver, it is connected to a chinese Crystal Mall where you could find all sort of chinese foods, the mall hour is from 11am-7pm but most of the food vendor and food market open at 9am. Very good value."
243327524,VCBCX1,Phoenix,2014-12-07,Vancouver X Inn,Nice clean hotel with comfortable bedding and very helpful staff. Convenient location close to metropolis shopping centre and skyrail n bus loop. Breakfast was not worth the price though however lots to eat at the food court in metropolis.
493646859,VCBCX1,"Phoenix, Arizona",2017-06-16,Vancouver X Inn,The people at the desk and the manager had the best customer service I ever have experienced. The beds were comfortable.The rooms were clean.It was very close to places to eat and visit.We definitely will stay here again . 
288972956,VCBCX1,"Pinehurst, North Carolina",2015-07-14,Vancouver X Inn,"We were here for the World Cup, as well as many other American families.  Stephanie at the front remembered my name the second morning there - WOW.  We got lucky for an upgrade to a suite, which worked well with 3 kids.  Lap pool, odd to get there through the fitness center, but good to relax at end of day.  Concierge lounge too for those with XT status.  Short walk to the train, easy ride downtown.  Quiet neighborhood."
162954205,VCBCX1,"Piscataway, New Jersey",2013-06-04,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed there for three nights on a business trip.  The XT was clean, quiet, well run and very accommodating.  The bed was super comfortable, like sleeping at home.  The staff was friendly and professional.  This location in Burnaby was situated in a very convenient location with access to the Sky Train, a huge shopping mall across the street, and at the intersection of the two main streets in Burnaby.  I'll stay there again when in Vancouver on business or pleasure."
557403939,VCBCX1,"Pitt Meadows, Canada",2018-01-30,Vancouver X Inn,I stayed at this hotel the night before my wedding and for my wedding night and was very disappointed. I phoned the hotel weeks prior to my stay to inform them that this was for a special occasion and to make sure the room was special. They forgot. My bridesmaid had to speak with the front desk to remind them to make sure the room was extra special for when we came back after the wedding. When my husband and I got back to the room the room was filthy. The housekeeper made the bed and sprinkled rose petals all over the floor and bed but failed to clean the rest of the room. There were used towels on the floor and the garbages were overflowing. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.
452536921,VCBCX1,"Pittsburgh, United States",2017-01-16,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is terrific. The staff and the employees are really on top of everything. The hotel's location is perfect, great restaurants, a mall, Sky Train within walking distance! Stay there you won't be sorry!"
292116029,VCBCX1,"Placerville, California",2015-07-24,Vancouver X Inn,"Great hotel for business or couples. Close walk to skytrain for 20 minute ride to downtown Vancouver. Neighborhood was different than anticipated, if you love Asian food your in luck. Nice quiet bar area. Didn't go to the 18th floor to use our diamond member services, can't review that but it is there so that's a plus too. We would stay at this property again. "
186827860,VCBCX1,"Plano, Texas",2013-12-05,Vancouver X Inn,We drove to Vancouver from Seattle and decided to stay outside the downtown area.  We did not want to deal with driving downtown during rush hour.  The XT Metrotown is located in Burnaby.  It is easy to reach by car and self parking is only $9C.  The hotel is located about 2 blocks from the SkyTrain which takes you into downtown.  One way ticket is $2.75C and you can purchase them via credit card at the machine.  It takes about 20 minutes via SkyTrain to be in the center of Vancouver.  There also is a hugh shopping mall 2 blocks from the hotel and next to the hotel is a large Chinese shopping mall.  The room was great.  Service was friendly.  They provided a map that detailed the area around the hotel and a map of the Vancouver area.
165499069,VCBCX1,"Plano, Texas",2013-06-27,Vancouver X Inn,"A greatbXT property in a convenient location.  We based our long weekend visit from this hotel and had no complaints.  Staff and rooms were great.  Access to the club room on the 18th floor was excellent.  Others mention the parking, but it is not that bad.  We ate at the restaurant one evening and the food was good but not outstanding for the price.  Sorely missing from the rooms are microwaves, fridges and kettles.  The coffee makers and coffee in the room was grey sludge producing cheap devices, but the coffee elsewhere in the hotel was superb.  Would we stay there again? Yes.  Would I prefer they add some additional amenities for the price - absolutely."
457393612,VCBCX1,"Plymouth, Minnesota",2017-02-05,Vancouver X Inn,"Spent two night at the XT Vancouver Metrotown and it was perfect for business.  They have a very attentive staff, and I hardly had to slow down walking out of the hotel right into a waiting cab.  The Opal Lounge on the 18th floor for frequent HH stayers makes a perfect spot for breakfast and happy hour without having to leave the hotel.  Again, the staff was great!"
415071590,VCBCX1,"Poipu, Hawaii",2016-09-05,Vancouver X Inn,"A little out of he way, but great Skytrain access to downtown.  A little pricey for the area, but clean and well appointed. Staff is very helpful and the rooms are beautiful and very comfortable. One of our favorite places to stay. "
510265171,VCBCX1,"Pontypridd, United Kingdom",2017-08-08,Vancouver X Inn,"So far all good apart for the smoke haze not affecting the breathing, but our room on the 16 floorwe have not seen the mountains yet.Sky Train and bus sevice very good and regular about 20 minutes to waterfront and Stanley Park,Granville Island also a must. Hotel staff very good in all departments and breakfast buffet or  or full hot breakfast also good..Will do another review in 18 days time. Burnaby a good place to work or play out of watch out a 400 shp mal 5 mis away!!!!"
290960086,VCBCX1,"Port Alberni, Canada",2015-07-20,Vancouver X Inn,"First time staying here, I am sure I will be back. Walking distance to shopping and transit. Service was amazing, in room dining was the best for value I have ever had and they were very accommodating to my last minute order. I need to stay on lower floors and they were able to change my room without a fuss. My favourite part may have been the deep bathtub!"
226202465,VCBCX1,"Port Alberni, Canada",2014-09-01,Vancouver X Inn,"I chose this hotel hoping for an elegant break after power-shopping and I was not disappointed.  I will always stay here when I shop at Metrotown.  The room was an excellent value for the money spent, the meals we enjoyed were varied, tasty and top quality.  The staff was pleasant and helpful"
357487103,VCBCX1,"Port Alberni, Canada",2016-03-21,Vancouver X Inn,I have stayed many times at this hotel for business and never had a problem.  The rooms are comfortable and clean.  The staff are amazing.  I can't say enough about the staff.  Room service is fast and hot.  The restaurant is comfortable and provides a great selection of food.
330792969,VCBCX1,"Port Coquitlam, Canada",2015-12-04,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed at this hotel for a work Christmas party so we didn't have to go home.  The room was clean and we had a minor issue with our lighted mirror and maintenance came up and fixed it in less than 5 mins.  I have had my work functions at this hotel for many years and this is the 2nd time I have stayed in a room. Room is clean and well maintained. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.
450606948,VCBCX1,"Port Coquitlam, Canada",2017-01-07,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel knows how to host the best Gala in town! It was our first time here and loved it! The use of all the ballrooms was done very well, access to everything was easy and help always readily available. We were granted a late check out and the staff were very friendly. Definitely will be back!"
518316877,VCBCX1,"Port Harcourt, Nigeria",2017-08-28,Vancouver X Inn,"We had a good summer holidays in Vancouver. We enjoyed the location of our Hotel (XT Metrotown) as it was across the shopping hall despite its surroundings had other shops. The XT Hotel staff were very receptive and speaks English fluently. Free water and Juice at the reception floor for both visits and Guests. We equally enjoyed the double rooms we occupied since we were a family of 4 as the room was equipped with microwave, refrigerator, hair dryer, etc. Although, the couch fitted with bed wasn't comfortable at all as the mattress was too light, we had to purchase additional comforter from the shop, which we could manage at that was the only option left for us. The Restaurant food is very delicious, more especial their BBG Dinner."
155725787,VCBCX1,"Portland, Oregon",2013-03-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Super friendly and accomidating, Very Clean and comfortable rooms.  Wonderful staff, not far from any of the towns plentiful attractions.  Reasonable rates.  The parking is decent and plenty of it.  Next door there is more chinese food than anywhere I have ever been.  Most of it is the same, just different ways of serving it.  The Hotel food is good, but somewhat limited, and of course, more expensive if your on a budget.  The room was wonderful, the beds very comfortable and clean, nice ammenities and appointments. Good flat screen TV, plenty of programming, the Internet was not free for wireless, but the CAT 5 hookup was lightning fast.No complaints.Wonderful time thank you!!"
242030189,VCBCX1,"Portland, Oregon",2014-11-29,Vancouver X Inn,"Booked a room here last minute on our way up to Whistler, so we didn't want to spend too much money on this quick stop. The location was an easy drive( or ride skytrain) into downtown for dinner, but far enough away to not have to pay downtown prices.  The room was smaller, but for one night was just what we needed. Easy and professional check in, clean room, underground parking was a little tight but we never had a problem finding a spot. We felt very comfortable here we will definitely stay here again, next time we will check out the shopping and take the train into the center."
463005414,VCBCX1,"Portland, Oregon",2017-02-26,Vancouver X Inn,Definitely would recommend! Right across the street from a huge mall and only 24 minutes from downtown Vancouver! We got to be close to downtown with out having to be downtown which was great! Everyone at this hotel was very sweet! We didn't do much near the hotel besides the HUGE hotel right across the street which was totally awesome. We had a convention in downtown Vancouver and it was such a breeze to get to.From Oregon in the states. 
303931980,VCBCX1,"Portland, United States",2015-08-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Friendly and courteous staff.  Decent, clean room. Good food in the restaurant.  Dinner server left a little to be desired.  Breakfast server was excellent.  We were just passing thru so only spent one night."
441230374,VCBCX1,"Powell River, Canada",2016-11-30,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at the XT in Metrotown mainly for the location and to do some shopping. The room was very nice, roomy and comfortable. We didn't try the restaurant as we were just there one night. The building is older and there is construction in the area at street level, but it suited our needs and was one of the more reasonable in our price range in Burnaby. Underground parking is convenient."
464202558,VCBCX1,"POWELL RIVER, Canada",2017-03-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Hotel bellman very friendly and helped with my bags.  Rooms were clean.  Internet service was great.  Food in the restaurant was very tasty, waiter knew about allergy information.  Check in and check out was very efficient."
477876768,VCBCX1,PR,2017-04-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Rooms were clean and spacious, had Peter Thomas Roth bathroom products, staff were always cheerful and helpful, had a generous breakfast buffet for $21 (recommend going early), location was great- close to Metrotown!  "
362664066,VCBCX1,"Prince Albert, Canada",2016-04-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Really awesome staff. Thank you for treating my grandchildren with kindness and service that was genuine and friendly. I wanted them to have a grand adventure and you made that both possible and realized. Above and beyond several times.That said not everything was 5 star, or even 4, but everything possible was done to satisfy us. I suggest updating the pool and hot tub and make it 'accessible' (Im told this is planned for); also have pet peeve re hotels who do not put attention to the amenities that don't make money, like the pool - and wifi, and the bad card system (constant frustrations) for the elevator. Room should have had a real fridge and a table with chairs. Even so, I have to say the location and great staff and BEST beds ever! (seriously all 4 of us slept 10 hours every single day! unheard of! truly wonderful sleeps) made it all worthwhile."
477311841,VCBCX1,Prince George,2017-04-19,Vancouver X Inn,"We have never been disappointed when staying at a XT Hotel. Our family joined us for the Easter Brunch and it was outstanding. We like the location, close to Metro Town and family. Having stayed at this property a number of times we can recommend it."
235815245,VCBCX1,Prince George,2014-10-22,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel is quiet and has comfortable spacious rooms. Its within a block of a large mall with access to busses and the metro and lots of restaurants.  I have stayed here a few times and its always great.
572846397,VCBCX1,"Prince George, Canada",2018-04-12,Vancouver X Inn,"When I had contacted the XT and advised them why I was heading down to Vancouver, they were very sympathetic.  When my family arrived at the hotel the Front desk upgraded me which I was surprised.  The room we stayed in was clean, the beds were comfortable and even better it was quiet.  My daughter ended up getting sick from the flu and when I went searching for items to help her the door man was able to help me out.  I have stayed here before and would stay here again.  The XT was very close to the Cemetery where we had my fathers funeral.   To give ourselves a break from the emotional roller coaster we were on we went across the street to Metrotown.  This hotel is close to Shopping and the Skytrain."
227910616,VCBCX1,"Prince George, Canada",2014-09-09,Vancouver X Inn,"I stay at this hotel in August 2013 because of the convenient location and comfortable rooms. It is a few minutes' walk from the Metrotown mall and close to the skytrain (rail style transit that links you to Vancouver from the Burnaby area).  If you arriving at the Vancouver (Richmond area) airport, it is less stressful to drive there than to go to a downtown hotel. The beds are always comfortable, and there is air conditioning. If I am travelling with family, we choose the room with two queen beds and ask if a small fridge is available. It is also supposedly petfriendly although I haven't stayed there with a pet. The staff have always been friendly."
362444017,VCBCX1,"Prince George, Canada",2016-04-07,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel should have everything going for it: good location, friendly helpful staff, lovely, clean building and rooms, and many amenities. But you have to use your room key card to operate the elevator; frequently, the card does not work, leaving you riding up and down until someone else's card (most often a total stranger) lets you select the correct floor. Sometimes your card works and sometimes it doesn't.  I would never stay here again and I can't recommend it to anyone else. In future, I will not stay at any hotel that has such a system."
171423224,VCBCX1,"Prince George, Canada",2013-08-08,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff here was very helpful in assisting me with directions to the testing centre I was booked into within MetroTown Center (Cambridge College).  I would never have found that place without her help!  On the flip side, for a $200 plus per night room charge, I was extremely annoyed to be charged an additional $8.00 for WiFi internet access."
452536468,VCBCX1,"Prince George, Canada",2017-01-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Hundreds of guests wait outside in cold for hotel to clear fire alarm in error and then wait longer for employees to unlock the floors to provide guests with, at least, the ability to walk back up (up to 14 floors) to be able to go back to sleep after a nearly 2 hour disruption at 3am."
308412019,VCBCX1,"Prince George, Canada",2015-09-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Love the location.  It is a quick 5 minute walk to Metro Town Mall.  The rooms are clean, and the Hotel is well kept.

567135132,VCBCX1,"Prince George, Canada",2018-03-17,Vancouver X Inn,Make you you check out the restaurant! Staff is amazing and rooms are comfy. Mall next door is nice to check out. Location right next to sky train and Metrotown mall. $40.00 cab ride to airport. Drinks in lounge were delicious!
489197470,VCBCX1,"Prince George, Canada",2017-05-30,Vancouver X Inn,"Pool was terribly small. Nice room. Fridge didn't work well. Lots of spoiled food. Hotel did provide some food however, the cubed up cheese in the container provided was moldy . Manager argued that it wasn't mold . "
197800470,VCBCX1,Prince Rupert,2014-03-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Very satisfied with this Hotel. The hotel staff has always been most helpful and friendly. The maid service is wonderful, they kept my room tidy and clean and I never had to ask for anything. Very thoughtful and always little extras like chocolates on the pillow and the newspaper delivered to your door. Great specials like the 2 for 1 buffet and the option of upgrading to a suite for a very nominal fee. Very quiet and comforting to stay at this Hotel. Have never had a problem with noise and I am super fussy about having my peace and quiet. I travel a lot and have stayed in many resorts and Hotels and I have to say the XT is the only one where I have never had to complain about noise. I absolutely love this Hotel and it is the only place I will stay when in the lower mainland. Everything here met and exceeded my expectations."
235421284,VCBCX1,"Puyallup, Washington",2014-10-20,Vancouver X Inn,Our Conference Football Officials use the XT Metrotown as our hotel for Simon Fraser games.  Excellent friendly staff and great service.  Needed extra towels for the crew and were easy to get.  Valet parking is quick and easy to use.  Room was large and well appointed.  No noise and just a super hotel.
396648317,VCBCX1,"Qualicum Beach, Canada",2016-07-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Short stay during a quick trip to Vancouver.  We got an excellent rate for a summer weekend.The hotel is perfectly located, a short walk to the Metrotown Skytrain station.  This gives easy and cheap access to downtown without driving and looking for parking.The building is new, clean and well maintained. The staff were absolutely wonderful.  Everyone was happy, eager to please and helpful.We had a standard room which was good sized, functional, clean and quiet.  The working desk was decently sized.  Bed and pillows were comfy.Bathroom was smallish but not cramped.  Everything worked.  We had a cheap rate so the Wifi was not included but it was not overly expensive anyway.As noted the Skytrain is a 4 minute walk from the hotel and there are lots of restaurants and shopping options close by.All in all a quiet, comfortable stay with easy access."
317238670,VCBCX1,"Qualicum Beach, Canada",2015-10-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Love this hotel and staff.  I come for business about 5-6 times a year and the service is always so friendly and efficient.  The staff deserves a huge pat on the back for their service!  Restaurant and Lounge is terrific! Close to GREAT shopping (a block  away).  How can you go wrong with the XT Metrotown, Burnaby!"
475182753,VCBCX1,"Qualicum Beach, Canada",2017-04-12,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  I always look forward to seeing them again on my business trips.

158419141,VCBCX1,"Qualicum, Canada",2013-04-20,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a clean and quiet hotel just a short walk from Metrotown, with many restaurants within walking distance. There is some construction going on which can detract from the view, but otherwise a nice vista. I suggest not venturing too far up Kingsways, though, as the neighbourhood  degrades quickly after Metrotown."
433703195,VCBCX1,"Queen Charlotte City, Canada",2016-11-01,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here because it was close to the mall by we were there for a BC children's visit, the cab was waiting outside and the hospital was approximately a $35.00 cab ride which wasn't bad at all for what we got at the hotel it was worth it, will definitely be staying there again "

398842972,VCBCX1,"Rancho Santa Margarita, California",2016-07-29,Vancouver X Inn,"The worst XT I've ever stayed at Rude staff, front desk personnel were terrible rude and confrontational. They treated my guest with no respect and did not allow them into there room because they came in late. They were advised that the gust would be coming in after 12 am late flight. Woke us all up had to go down and get them. Plus had to take attitude from the desk personnel."
523040208,VCBCX1,"Reading, United Kingdom",2017-09-10,Vancouver X Inn,"Lets start on the positive side, the room is big and reasonably furnished. One easy chair. Check in or out is easy.On the negative side, the car park is not easy to negotiate with inadequate signs and people ignoring the one way system.I was there on a Sunday but I had to get down to level 4 before I can find a space. There are no signs telling you that 1-3 are full so you have to do the rounds and discover the joy of the car park.There is a pool on the third floor. When we were there, it was dominated by children with their parents refusing to supervise and there were nobody from the hotel to keep order. They were jumping in and out of all the pools despite signs saying no diving etc and screaming their heads off. This went on till well beyond 10pm. We can hear the noise from the 10 th floor with closed windows. I suppose thats what happens with family friendly hotels."
314967062,VCBCX1,"Red Deer, Canada",2015-09-29,Vancouver X Inn,"It was a very nice hotel to stay. Stayed in a King Suite. Great Hotel, nice location, friendly staff. I stayed in this hotel as part of a business trip. The only negative point is about parking. They have a paid parking in basement which is quite difficult. There are many different sections in this parking. Other than that everything is great."
559282879,VCBCX1,"Redmond, Oregon",2018-02-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Have to pay $16 a day for parking, first time my entire life having to pay additional for parking at a hotel! You have to pay to use the WIFI itâ€™s not included, also no complementary breakfast. And staff was really rude and brief. "
441038383,VCBCX1,"Redmond, United States",2016-11-29,Vancouver X Inn,"The room is nice, well arranged and clean.  Complimentary bottle water and quality coffee are much appreciated.  Very good experience for the entire family.  We will visit it again next time we are in the area.  Keep the good work."
636738525,VCBCX1,"Redmond, Washington",2018-11-30,Vancouver X Inn,Great location with quick access to a mega mall with a theater for family fun and large park for walking the dog. Electric vehicle chargers are available onsite.  Lots of interesting small markets to go and visit.  I've been multiple times to this location.  Great each time.
305191626,VCBCX1,"Redmond, Washington",2015-08-30,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff is amazing.  Very friendly and helpful.  Great location close to skytrain, Metrotown mall, and many restaurants.

353012539,VCBCX1,"Revelstoke, Canada",2016-03-03,Vancouver X Inn,I have stayed in this hotel on many occasions and have always been impressed by the care the staff show for the guests. The executive lounge is a real gem. To have a service of this kind is a real extra. It is an hotel that I always return to as it provides me with everything I need and with an inbuilt quality that the staff plainly work hard to achieve.
182649467,VCBCX1,"Revelstoke, Canada",2013-10-27,Vancouver X Inn,Very pleasant stay and close to all amenities.  The front staff were helpful in locating the perfect dinner spot.  Had a fantastic sleep in a comfortable bed.  Breakfast was great and our service was both relaxed and entertaining!  I will definitely be heading back!  Quality for a great price!
592995083,VCBCX1,"Richland, Washington",2018-07-04,Vancouver X Inn,"Overall it's not a bad hotel.  I wanted a hotel in Vancouver. After we got there and checked in we discovered this is actually in Burnaby, a few miles from Vancouver. But it's only a block walk to the train which is easy to ride into downtown Vancouver to avoid parking there. This hotel is near a shopping mall too. But it's very misleading when they say "
456464654,VCBCX1,"Richmond Hill, Canada",2017-02-01,Vancouver X Inn,"I am frequently in BC and based on availability - thought I'd try something new.  I was booked into this location  and was pleasantly surprised when I arrived.  I was upgraded to their club floor - with access to the club room.  What a great place to unwind with a glass of wine and the chance to meet some other people.  They had healthy snacks, as well as some tastee but not so good-for-me stuff.I am a repeat for sure."
278058487,VCBCX1,"Richmond Hill, Canada",2015-06-05,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice hotel, very close to restaurants and a shopping centre.  rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet.  I found the rates very reasonable.  Restaurant had good food, nice service - but is location in an odd location in the building.  Took me a little while to get to it (on the 3rd floor) - as it was not clearly marked."
165395355,VCBCX1,"Richmond, Canada",2013-06-26,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel is close to everything . The staff are terrific. Many nice restaurants available for dinner and breakfast. Close to the sky train for easy access to downtown events such as concerts and sporting events. An Asian Mall is beside the hotel and available for lunch and a fresh fruit and vegetables.
327305155,VCBCX1,"Richmond, Canada",2015-11-16,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel has a great location with the metrotown mall across the street.  Lots of restaurants to choose from within walking distance.  Skytrain is at the mall so you can venture downtown quite easily. The staff are very friendly.  Underground parkade was not the easiest to get around in.
200512999,VCBCX1,"Richmond, Virginia",2014-04-09,Vancouver X Inn,"I got to the hotel and I was quite surprised the hotel was not closer to downtown Vancouver. We had a wonderful stay at this location but we did decide to move to a downtown hotel with a balcony. Overall I would rate this hotel as wonderful, but I really wanted a balcony! :)"
617756227,VCBCX1,"Riviera Maya, Mexico",2018-09-18,Vancouver X Inn,Excellent hotel with friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is located close to the Metro Skyline so getting around is easy. Our bellman gave us suggestions on what to see and the best way to travel there. He also provided us with discount coupons for attractions.
373907347,VCBCX1,"Rochester, United States",2016-05-17,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at this hotel for a week in early April visiting friends and relative in Burnaby and Vancouver area.  We had a suite with a king bed and pullout queen sofa bed.  Complimentary standard speed wi fi (54 mbps) was reasonable; dorm fridge was convenient to store food and snacks.  Nice exercise facility and outdoor pool.  Local phone calls were complimentary.  Parking was a bit expensive (good thing that we did not have a car).  Great convenient location - 5 min walk to Metrotown skytrain station and Metrotown shopping mall, and hotel is connected to Crystal Mall.  Complimentary national Globe and Mail or Vancouver Sun newspaper.  Courteous staff."
178663642,VCBCX1,"Rochester, United States",2013-09-24,Vancouver X Inn,"I was here for a conference that was held at the hotel. Very impressed with the quality of service I received from all the staff I interacted with. Impressed that the lap pool is heated and wished I brought appropriate clothes for swimming. I had a beautiful mountain view from my room. Not as impressed that they charged for internet access in the rooms-- at least in the business center I could access for free. Overall, impressed with this hotel."
497283650,VCBCX1,"Rocklin, California",2017-06-29,Vancouver X Inn,Great hotel just outside of the city. The skytrain is within walking distance and gets you into downtown in 20 minutes. We stayed in a suite. Very spacious with comfortable bed and pillows. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They even loaned us an umbrella on a rainy day. Parking was a little spendy but always had access in and out and felt safe. Would have no problem staying here again.
480293640,VCBCX1,"Rockwood, Canada",2017-04-30,Vancouver X Inn,Great location easy access to highways and many restaurants. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are spacious and clean. I had the King suite came with a fridge as well. Beds are very comfortable. 
217496277,VCBCX1,"Rothenburg, Switzerland",2014-07-25,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here twice for a short time, the first one was quite good. The hotel is located well and the area is quiet. We however, wouldn't recommend this hotel, for during the second stay the second bed was a really uncomfortable sofa-bed and we had to call them to set it up. Furthermore the internet access is not free, they charge you 8$ per day and you cannot connect more than 3 devices per room even though  they allow up to 4 people per room. The breakfast available is good, the waiters however are slow and they charge you additionally if there are more than two people in your room."
487627821,VCBCX1,Rotterdam,2017-05-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Why on earth do hotels still use these big, noisy, power-hungry roaring ice machines on every floor. The sound fills entire hallways and coridoors and penetrates through walls...When we checked in and asked for a quiet room, we were given a room on floor 5 ('the highest available', according to the person at the desk) that was badly affected by this kind of 'sound pollution', and overlooked a messy building site accross the street. Especially the noise made the room unacceptable.We returned to the desk to ask for a quieter room and to our surprise were given one on floor 9. It was further away from the ice machine on that floor, and had a much nicer view."
223542669,VCBCX1,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",2014-08-21,Vancouver X Inn,"This is my second stay for 10 days at the XT Metrotown in Vancouver.The rooms are nice with excellent beds; service is fantastic; people are extremely helpful and friendly; and the location is ideal. I would highly recommend this hotel, and I will be staying there again."
185921490,VCBCX1,"Round Rock, Texas",2013-11-25,Vancouver X Inn,"Great property, well located, and with a great staff. Only issues were key card would not operate the elevator consistently.  Had a lamp in the room that did not work and my shower had a leak that had me mopping water off the floor every morning."
234102911,VCBCX1,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",2014-10-13,Vancouver X Inn,"My second stay at The XT Metrotown so I had high expectations, the beds were even more comfortable than I remember, the room cleaner, and the team at the desk extra welcoming and helpful, I always find the breakfast food almost tasteless in big hotels, but it was fresh and well presented,In summary the hotel&quot; does just what it says on the tin&quot;"
180299649,VCBCX1,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",2013-10-09,Vancouver X Inn,"Booked online from the UK I was delighted to find a super comfortable bed,spacious  spotless room, great breakfast served by attentive team, and just 10 minutes walk from the Skytrain or the Shopping Mall. The only extra I would have liked was fresh milk for my teamaking in my room!"
187328636,VCBCX1,"Saanichton, Canada",2013-12-10,Vancouver X Inn,We have stayed twice at this hotel and each trip was perfect.  We find it good value to book a room on the executive floor.  Your room charge includes appies in the evening and breakfast in the morning on the 18th floor.  It really is good value.  Also the hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of Metrotown and Skytrain.  Would stay here again when visiting Vancouver.  Staff are excellent and very accommodating.
372466854,VCBCX1,"Sabetha, Kansas",2016-05-12,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a nice modern hotel, close to quite a lot to do in Metrotown part of Vancouver.  Close to shopping and restaurants.  On-site restaurant was good.  Right next door to an Asian market, which is interesting to walk through.  Staff was always friendly and helpful.  Parking available in an underground garage."
219158259,VCBCX1,"Sackville, Canada",2014-08-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Should one not want to stay in downtown Vancouver, the XT hotel in Metrotown offers an extremely central location in Burnaby.  Only a moment's walk away is the Metrotown Mall, the largest mall in British Columbia.  The skytrain station is also right down the street, so the location is definitely a plus of this hotel.  The view from our room was very nice, and the room itself was clean and trendy.  The restaurant was empty, but the food and service were very good.  I did not like that wifi was not complimentary to regular guests (it was, however free for XT Honours).  If one does not want to pay for wifi, there is a business centre downstairs.  There is an outdoor pool, but I didn't have the chance to use it.  Despite these pros, I just did not feel this hotel, I don't know why.  I would, however, definitely recommend!"
177611391,VCBCX1,Sacramento,2013-09-17,Vancouver X Inn,I have been staying at the XT Metrotown for many years on my monthly trips to Vancouver.  Sergio and his team are top notch and I always look forward to my visits.  This is the only hotel I use when I travel to the Vancouver area even if it is a bit out of my way!  Keep up the great work.
498094547,VCBCX1,"Sacramento, California",2017-07-02,Vancouver X Inn,"We happened to find a nice room at XT Vancouver metro town after  finding out that several hotels in the heart of Vancouver were booked or way over priced. When we check in, we asked where some good places to eat and grab a craft beer in Gas Town were. We took the sky train to gas town and went sampling. We found the flying pig, which was great! We seen the steam clock, and walked about 6 looking at different stores. The locals were very friendly and helpful and we found that taking the sky train allowed us to see parts of Vancouver that we wouldn't have seen in a car. Plus, we didn't have to worry about drinking and drinking. It was a great convenience that we would not have known about if we didn't stay at the XT in metro town! Check it out, it is a great place to stay.  "

427099946,VCBCX1,"Saint Louis, Missouri",2016-10-11,Vancouver X Inn,Took Skytrain from the airport to Metrotown station. It was very easy and took about 50 minutes. Metrotown shopping mall is a block away. The hotel was very nice. Arrived before 3:00 check in but our room was ready. The room was huge and setup nicely. Breakfast and evening hor d'oeuvres were excellent. The staff were all very friendly and pleasant. It is not downtown but this is much better.
288000496,VCBCX1,"Saint Louis, Missouri",2015-07-11,Vancouver X Inn,"Wonderful stay here.  Rooms were well kept, clean, and spacious.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Fitness center and pool were modern and well kept.   The only downside that it's a distance from the city center, however - just take the train in."
211173674,VCBCX1,"saint-hyacinthe, Canada",2014-06-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Although I only stayed the night, I was greeted as a gold member, upgraded to a corner room, which was amazing.  Windows on both sides.  Very spacious and comfortable.  This hotel is close to the shopping mall with over 400 stores, but is attached to an Asian Market, very interesting to walk around and see the different stores."
561725021,VCBCX1,"Salmon Arm, BC",2018-02-20,Vancouver X Inn,"I came here for business and was greeted by the front desk staff. They were very helpful and friendly. I noticed a few things in my room that may have been overlooked by the cleaning staff and after a short phone call I was being moved to a new room. They sent someone to help me with my bags and they checked in with me after to make sure I was comfortable in my new room. The staff at the restaurant were exceptional with amazing attention to detail and remembering faces. I have read previous reviews, complaining about room size etc but I would take a hotel with fabulous customer service over a larger room any day! I will definitely be coming back!"
452034333,VCBCX1,"Salmon Arm, Canada",2017-01-14,Vancouver X Inn,The rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff is excellent. The men working at the front door are always cheerful and helpful. The door from the hallway to my room was really poorly designed. Had to close the bathroom door to get to my hallway door. Very narrow. Room service meal was great. Breakfast was disappointing as the yogurt and granola had big chunks of melon instead of berries and there was about a tablespoon of granola.
235826696,VCBCX1,"Salmon Arm, Canada",2014-10-22,Vancouver X Inn,"Our stay there for a family wedding was extremely pleasant and all the transportation needs were handled efficiently.  Quiet room, comfy beds.  We upgraded the parking and breakfast although others in our party did not seem to know about this.  Perhaps they didn't register for it.  But I thought it was a good added value."
313919124,VCBCX1,"Salmon Arm, Canada",2015-09-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Very nice room.  Classy hotel, good service, very clean.  Free parking is nice, big sized room, firm comfortable beds.  It's location next to Metrotown Mall is nice (across street).  Only negatives.. No great view - given its in Vancouver/Burnaby."
359948716,VCBCX1,"Salt Lake City, United States",2016-03-29,Vancouver X Inn,"The room was a little bit empty, too much space in the room. The light of the bathroom was automatically turned off when my wife was taking shower, which scared her a little bit. When I checked in, I was told by a manager that as a diamond member I can use the lounge in the 18th floor for breakfast. But the next morning my room card did not allow me to access into the lounge, which made me very embarrassed. I had to go to the lobby and asked a hotel staff to activate my card. Overall, although the rewards price was good, it was not good experience in this XT hotel."
331330704,VCBCX1,"Salt Lake City, Utah",2015-12-07,Vancouver X Inn,"I stay here quite regularly for work, and it is a great location in my opinion. It's about 25 mins from the airport, and right in the center of Burnaby. Nearby is Metrotown mall with a tonne of stores, a host of restaurants to choose from and cinema as well if you want to catch a movie. Across the street there is also a supermarket in case you need to pick up any amenities. The only downside of this hotel is that parking at the hotel is additional fee, and can be very congested. Overall if you are looking for a good place to stay while on business, it's a good choice."
314966607,VCBCX1,"Salt Spring Island, Canada",2015-09-29,Vancouver X Inn,I stayed in this Hotel while I attended a social function. The staff/caterer were excellent. The Hotel location in downtown Burnaby was just right. Parking is available in the underground and is well lit. I would certainly highly recommend this Hotel.
214228488,VCBCX1,"San Antonio, Texas",2014-07-07,Vancouver X Inn,"The Metrotown XT is in a great location. It's near an Asian market, with some good food options and a bakery. A shopping mall is nearby with shopping and food options as well. It's a short walk to the SkyTrain. We used this daily to get around town. The service and the staff were great. We would stay here again."
495944020,VCBCX1,"San Antonio, United States",2017-06-25,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel was located in a great area.  Plenty of food and shops.  The public transportation sub was a block away which made it convenient.  The room upgrade had a beautiful view of the mountains and city skyline.
193314362,VCBCX1,"San Diego, California",2014-02-05,Vancouver X Inn,"Really enjoyed my stay here. The cost was great for the quality received. Rooms were clean and comfortable, the concierge was extremely knowledgeable and helpful, the entire staff was friendly and available every time I needed something, the executive lounge had wonderful drinks and desserts, I had a refrigerator in my room which is usually a must, the cleaning staff was also excellent. Room service food was okay - my scrambled eggs in particular were nothing to write home about but edible. However, everything else was great! The location was also quite central in Burnaby and the metro (sky train) was just a few minutes walk away which allowed me to get downtown quite cheaply and conveniently. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again when I come to visit!!"
208403912,VCBCX1,"San Diego, California",2014-06-01,Vancouver X Inn,I should rate it as average as it's what you expect from a XT.  But there are so many bad XT's around that wouldn't be fair.  I'm hhonors diamond so I travel a lot.  This place was nice clean good bed good showers and a decent desk to work in your room.   Not what I'd pick but it worked.   I didn't eat here or use any services.  But it was a nice clean updated place.  I'd stay here again next time I'm in Vancouver.   Meeting expectations is a good thing.  That's all I really ask for and as simple as that seems.... Many fail.  This was a good place to stay.  
410209505,VCBCX1,"San Diego, California",2016-08-24,Vancouver X Inn,"The XT Hotel itself was great. The room was very nice and spacious. The area of town has a lot of construction and somewhat low-end businesses all around. There is a rather large mall within walking distance. The mall itself was fairly nice. We went to the movies there. It took about 30 minutes to drive to the airport. Unless I completely missed it, there are no freeways around this part of town."
409037296,VCBCX1,San Francisco,2016-08-22,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is a distance from downtown Vancouver but the Skytrain station and a bus terminal is a five minute walk away. They provide a ride to anywhere in town and a straight shot to Canada Place/ Waterfront. There are good restaurants in the area and a huge mall. The hotel itself is as blah as they come. Breakfast is standard with the usual choice of continental, buffet or ala carte. You'll save by staying a distance from town but if you want a more exciting place to stay, spend a bit more and stay nearer the center of the city."
528841224,VCBCX1,San Francisco Bay Area (CA),2017-10-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Just left from a weekend stay in the Vancouver region.  This hotel is not in Vancouver or near the airport, but I guess that is its attraction.  "
382659426,VCBCX1,"San Francisco, Brazil",2016-06-14,Vancouver X Inn,"Stay at this hotel if you're rich, if you like staying a generic hotels and need to be around rich people.  If you want to experience Vancouver, stay inn or near Chinatown, where you're 3 minutes away from a BUNCH of things to see and fun things to do, from everything."
201042411,VCBCX1,"San Francisco, CA",2014-04-14,Vancouver X Inn,"This was a nice find.  This hotel is certainly not in downtown Vancouver as others have noted, but it has the benefits of being a XT, being reasonably priced, being very close to the airport (20-40 minutes depending upon the time of day), and being very close to the Skytram (5 minutes on foot) which will take you to many key downtown sites (or nearby) within 30 minutes.  The service was excellent (especially that provided by bellman Joseph) and the executive lounge was quite impressive for a &quot;lesser&quot; XT--pleasant staff and decent food options.  A big plus of the hotel is that it is adjacent to the Crystal Mall which offers abundant cheap and tasty Asian food options.  The hotel has a fixed price deal with a taxi company for airport trips, but note this fixed price may not be cheapest price given the time of day, but it takes away the hassle and worry..."
611240272,VCBCX1,"San Francisco, California",2018-08-27,Vancouver X Inn,"Overall it's an OK hotel with tiny (but well cleaned) rooms and super friendly staff. We stayed for 3 nights, and regardless of when we arrived, the hotel designated parking, which XT shares with other businesses, was full and we needed to spend extra time looking for a spot. Premium internet is slow (1MB/sec): for XXI century you would expect at least 10MB/sec or more, plus you would have to login every time you stop your session. Breakfast buffet is good. We custom ordered a few dishes and on average it took them 20-30 min to deliver, which is a lot for a simple omelet. The location is okay - safe and clean outside, except the large construction work in front of the entrance which would divert the foot traffic around the fence. The SkyTrain stop if 5 min walk, hence the convenience and noise from the passing trains. Overall, it was a good experience, but next time we will probably look for something closer to the downtown."
370003286,VCBCX1,"San Francisco, California",2016-05-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Upon arrival to this hotel we noticed a strange odor spewing from it. I believe this to be the smell of some sort of Asian food. It was horrific, my children were gagging. Went with a large group, all with children....the pool was closed until the last night, and when it was opened finally it was barely as big as a bathtub.  That's not the worst thing. About 30 people in our group has contracted the norovirus and is still suffering. I will not recommend nor ever will I come back to this property. "
472032745,VCBCX1,"San Francisco, California",2017-04-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Metrotown is a great location in Greater Vancouver Area, and this hotel is just beside the central shopping mall of Metrotown. Bedding is very comfortable and everything is model XT standards. The room has a beautiful city view with the mountainous north. Also, the transportation is convenient as it is so close to the Skytrain station."
632452607,VCBCX1,"San Francisco, California",2018-11-10,Vancouver X Inn,"If you expect to get reimbursed, make sure you spend time at the front desk or calling them up after your visit to remind them to send your receipt to you. This XT doesn't do it automatically. Drives me NUTS! I have a much better experience at the free-back-massage Executive Plaza (which for me is a bit more out of the way)"
286351913,VCBCX1,"San Francisco, California",2015-07-07,Vancouver X Inn,XT Metrotown is located out of Vancouver but can be reached by metro. We were driving from Banff and stayed here for a night. Hotel location is convenient and a very large shopping mall is nearby as are many restaurants and shops. Might try again on next trio to Vancouver.
301363448,VCBCX1,"San Francisco, United States",2015-08-19,Vancouver X Inn,"I really love the staff at XT Metrotown, esp. those at the Front Desk + Concierge.  When you are spending 180+ days a year on the road, small things like being greeted by name and just knowing that they will always try to take care of me makes all the difference in the world.  They are the reason why I keep coming back to XT Metrotown for 6+ years now (despite also being a SPG Platnium 100 and a new Westin Elements just opened next door!)    If more XTs are like this (esp. the London ones...), I will definitely stay more at XT properties!"
288403209,VCBCX1,"san francisco, United States",2015-07-12,Vancouver X Inn,"Location ! this XT is close to Skytrain station, which will take you to most popular places in 30min. also Metrotown is across the street, great shopping mall. Crystal mall is also next door, if you feel like traditional Chinese food. room is nice, service is great, view is awesome. only thing I don't like is the gym, it's tiny, has only 4 cardio machines."
356466960,VCBCX1,"san francisco, United States",2016-03-17,Vancouver X Inn,"A great location. Next time I will get in earlier so I can enjoy the area. Reasonably convenient to where I need to be. The staff was very nice, efficient and made the extra effort even though I got there after 11;00 am. I will be back."
609401973,VCBCX1,"San Jose, California",2018-08-22,Vancouver X Inn,"Mostly very positive with a couple of issues. The location is excellent: walking distance from the huge Metrotown Mall, the Skytrain, and many restaurants. Although a bit old, The room was large, quiet (ours faced away from the construction project), clean, and very comfortable. The one thing lacking was a bathroom fan - steamy from the shower. The young woman at check in was very professional and helpful. Likewise, the bell captain was very good. In contrast, a couple of millennial males at the registration desk had a laugh and smirk at our expense as we came through the lobby one weekday evening back to our room. Disappointing behavior from XT employees toward paying guests. These frat boys are too immature to work at McDonaldâ€™s. "
391231215,VCBCX1,"San Jose, California",2016-07-10,Vancouver X Inn,"Nice and clean hotel with a great staff. Easy walk to the Sky Train station for getting into the city. A bit difficult for driving to and from downtown as Kingsway is not an ideal road for quick travel, but the hotel itself worked out."
472116173,VCBCX1,"San Jose, California",2017-04-02,Vancouver X Inn,Does not live up to XT standards.  Should have stayed at the Element Hotel across the street. Rooms are  old looking and the food is terrible.  Really expected much more.  The only good part was the free WiFi
361677995,VCBCX1,San Juan,2016-04-04,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed in a new room that was very nice with a great view of the harbour. Good location. Easy to walk to all areas of vancouver downtown. We enjoyed our say very much and would stay here again. Thumbs up.
371633853,VCBCX1,San Leandro,2016-05-09,Vancouver X Inn,Construction right across streetBug in lane pool.  Poll was way too hot.  Location made us miss Vancouver completely.  Not helpful to get us to the ferry to Victoria.  Terrible staff.  Could not even speak Proper English.  Could not even understand the man from India???  Elevator did not work properly.  Other guests and I could not get to our floor.  The controls were loose and falling apart.  I feel I need a refund or a partial refund.  Bev Berrish  room 1118  on the 6th of May.  Thank You!
337414650,VCBCX1,"San Mateo, California",2016-01-04,Vancouver X Inn,"When we use our free breakfast voucher and picked the food, the waiter told us we can only pick the cold food for free, because we got hot stuff like sausage and potato, she will have to charge us $4 per person. We said this was not informed in advance, she insist this is the way they charge and the attitude was rude. Should not this be explained when voucher was given? Who wants a cold breakfast anyway?The basic internet speed is very slow, if you want a faster speed for video you have to buy the premium one. The room cleaning service is poorly done, the bed sheet are not changed and we saw hires from someone else when check in, and the floor is not vacuum daily that the dirty still left.This is our 4th straight year staying here, I liked it a lot in past, but now has to think if to come back next time."
248194014,VCBCX1,"San Mateo, California",2015-01-07,Vancouver X Inn,"Whenever we visit back Vancouver this hotel is our home, everything is convenient, shopping, sky train etc. room is large and clean, service is super efficient, staff are friendly, pets accepted, please keep it up and we will surely come back again!"
191272490,VCBCX1,"San Mateo, California",2014-01-18,Vancouver X Inn,"This has been our home stay every time we travel to Vancouver, safe and clean, next to the major shopping center and skytrain station, pet friendly, an asian food court connected at 2nd floor, service is awesome! No regret."
550522829,VCBCX1,"San Mateo, California",2017-12-31,Vancouver X Inn,"We stay here again after 2 years, this time it was a pleasant experience, room service is in time and well done, hotel staff is friendly, satisfied with what we received, enjoyed the stay, will come back again!"
163329993,VCBCX1,"san rafael, United States",2013-06-07,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a great place to stay to visit Vancouver without a car. Right next door to a major shopping mall plus other amenities, like banks, and quick access to downtown and most parts of metro Vancouver via sky train and buses around the corner at Metrotown stop. Staff was unfailingly helpful and polite. Hotel was clean with nice furnishings, and quiet for sleep (not much noise from street traffic). Didn't get to try the pool, hot tub or workout gym, but all looked excellent."
316389589,VCBCX1,"Sandton, South Africa",2015-10-05,Vancouver X Inn,But then I will immediately contradict myself by saying its really close to the overland rail system which works well. In the end it worked out great to catch a train but also to make it to downtown Vancouver by the bay. It's a spacious room and I had great views. And for those of you who love a bit of shopping its right next door to a massive outlet mall with all the big brands you love
217590906,VCBCX1,"Santa Monica, California",2014-07-26,Vancouver X Inn,"My wife and I recently spent three nights at this hotel.  Our room was very fine, the hotel quiet, the bed great, the staff helpful.  The top floor executive lounge is a bit small and gets quite crowded near the end of breakfast time (go before 8am if you can).  As has been noted elsewhere, this hotel is near a big (ordinary) mall (one block) and the train to downtown (two blocks).  The neighborhood is best described as &quot;under construction&quot; but appears quite safe.  We would stay here again."
541504410,VCBCX1,"Santa Monica, California",2017-11-16,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed in this hotel, as a diamond member, in November 2017. I can thoroughly recommend this very good, all round hotel. The staff are great and engaging.  The proximity to downtown, the airport and other more remote parts of the city means that travel is easy!"

212773872,VCBCX1,"Sao Paulo, SP",2014-06-30,Vancouver X Inn,"It's a XT. Rooms are clean, well equipped and comfortable. There is no mistake. After a long trip and jet legged, the beds and wonderful pillows are just great. Staff is really nice and helpful. They are ready to give you directions and useful information. The restaurant, at the 3rd floor, is good and you'll find nice fish and chips to snack; another good thing at this World Cup times, is sitting in, watching the news and games and drinking a good wine, by the glass. A big shopping mall is on walking distance and the neighborhood is nice."
600010230,VCBCX1,"Sarasota, Florida",2018-07-26,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here for 3 nights and were happily upgraded to a king suite.  The room was very large and nice, and the bed and pillows were wonderful!  The staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  The hotel is within walking distance to a large mall and the Skytrain.  I would definitely stay here again if we return to Vancouver!"
259698553,VCBCX1,"Saratoga Springs, United States",2015-03-15,Vancouver X Inn,All the staff were very professional and made you feel like an individual.  Breakfast was good quality but overpriced. If I wasn't there for business I would not have eaten there.   Overall I would recommended this hotel as it was close to the SkyTrain and only took 25 mins to get downtown.
464633707,VCBCX1,"Saskatoon, Canada",2017-03-04,Vancouver X Inn,"I recently spent two nights at the hotel and wanted to acknowledge the exceptional service I received at the XT Vancouver Metrotown.  I can honestly say that everyone that I had contact with at the hotel was very focussed on customer service.  My first morning at the hotel I was greeted at the restaurant by the host (Susheel) and he welcomed me to the hotel.  In fact he welcomed me has a guest in his home, he took great pride in making people feel welcome.  I spend many nights a month away from home and have nevered been treated this well by a hotel.  My room was clean, quite and extremely comfortable.  The event I was attending the hotel sponsored the evening reception and the food was amazing!  I highly recommend this hotel and would absolutely book this location again!"
319482048,VCBCX1,"Saskatoon, Canada",2015-10-16,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed while visiting our daughter at SFU. The location is close to Metrotown Mall and easy access to Hwy 1. Our room was clean, comfortable and quiet. My only issue was the comforter had no filling left so I got cold at night.  Parking is extra but it is also underground.  We only ate breakfast in the restaurant and they were very accommodating for my food requirements.  Prices were probably at the top of the range for breakfast. We would stay again when in the area."
430494756,VCBCX1,"Saskatoon, Canada",2016-10-21,Vancouver X Inn,"I just back from my 3 night stay in Burnaby. The location, accommodation was very good.

499566863,VCBCX1,Schaffhausen,2017-07-06,Vancouver X Inn,"It's just a short ride away from the City Center, 5 Minutes away from the Skytrain Station Metrotown and the Shoppingcenter. Staff is extreamly friendly and hepfull with all your needs. Especialy the Staff at the Restaurant makes every effort to make your Start into the Day a happy one! Besouse of Canada Day, it wasn't easy to find a Hotelroom and the Prices where over average. But even if the Hotel was sold out, the entire Crew was verry helpfull!"
215016092,VCBCX1,"Scottsdale, Arizona",2014-07-12,Vancouver X Inn,"Within a few mins walk from the metro skytrain station, this hotel makes it convenient to go anywhere in Vancouver, Canada. Sure it is not in the downtown, but even if you stay at the downtown, you still have to take train/bus/taxi to go most of the place anyway. Front desk was very friendly with vast knowledge of the area. I stayed for two nights, the next day when I stopped by the front desk about something else, she asked about the day before. She remembered!Staff at the executive lounge was nice too.  Just food there was average, but I wasn't expecting much anyway."
376281721,VCBCX1,SE Asia,2016-05-24,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed here for 4 nights.  Our deluxe room was spacious and comfortable. Our continental breakfast was of good quality with a buffet of fresh cut fruits and quality Danishes and croissants. The hotel is about a 7 minute walk to Metrotown station on the Skytrain. It takes only about 15 minutes on the train to get to Canada Place downtown. It is connected to the Crystal Mall which has an Asian food court. 
413095795,VCBCX1,"SeaTac, Washington",2016-08-31,Vancouver X Inn,Overall a very nice XT located across the street from a large mall with several restaurants. The room was pleasant and had a nice view. Parking is underground and shares space with adjacent shopping however please be careful and park in the hotel designated spaces.I will stay here again when my travels bring me back to Burnaby. 
262855112,VCBCX1,Seattle,2015-02-06,Vancouver X Inn,"A very solid, predictable hotel with a very dependable and friendly staff.  Central to Burnaby and next door to the Skytrain and Metrotown Mall.  You can stay here and take the train into Downtown Vancouver in 20 mins.  That saves the hassles of parking in town.  They have a unique curved lap pool, hot tub and small exercise room.  The restaurant was remodeled a little while ago and is better but can still use some refinement with the main meals.  The lounge has a much better atmosphere now.  The Honors level has the lounge with afternoon appetizers and morning breakfast."
319965217,VCBCX1,Seattle,2015-10-18,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a nice hotel in an excellent location for food, shopping, etc.  The room was in good condition and clean.  The reception staff were good and check-in was efficient.  The parking is underground.  The clearance is pretty low (like with most garages in Vancouver area) and it may be challenging to park inside if you are carrying a rack.The complimentary WiFi works well.There is a small shopping mall connected to the hotel and there is also a large mall across the street."
217179176,VCBCX1,"Seattle, United States",2014-07-23,Vancouver X Inn,"This was one of the most average $250/night experiences I ever could have asked for. We paid for luxury, to be respected - not to be dime and nickel'd for the entire trip.  We left impressed by the service and friendliness of staff, but extremely annoyed at the steep cost of doing LITERALLY anything other than sitting in your room in the dark.   The staff was friendly, room was clean - Water was $2 / bottle, internet was $8/night for shoddy connections.   Everything has a price, it appears that $250/night gets you pretty much nothing at The XT anymore. I will be saving my money for other hotels for the future."
540331219,VCBCX1,"Seattle, United States",2017-11-11,Vancouver X Inn,"Friendly staff, warm, comfortable environment, excellent service. Try out the bar/restaurant for great service and food.  I have been a regular at this hotel for many years and am always amazed at how friendly everyone is, they remember you by name, and everyone goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and cared for.  Also great location as it is close to the MetroTown Mall and the sky train line.  Rooms are always clean and the overall upkeep of the hotel and premises is excellent"
309709140,VCBCX1,"Seattle, United States",2015-09-12,Vancouver X Inn,"We booked this hotel because of previous experiences with XT, thinking it would be a step above some of the other choices we were offered for our visit (soccer tournament). The hotel is located in what seems to be an international district and looked run down and old.  The pool is a one lane 'lap pool' but it is a very short lap.  Overall the hotel did not meet up to our expectations."
161292105,VCBCX1,"Seattle, United States",2013-05-15,Vancouver X Inn,"I can't say anything bad about my stay. The valet outside was helpful and patient. My room was incredibly clean and comfortable, breakfast was delicious and the lady working in the Opal Room was on top of cleaning up after guests as they finished eating. The lobby staff was softspoken, kind, and quick. I will book here again the next time I visit. Everyone was just lovely."
162929403,VCBCX1,"Seattle, United States",2013-06-03,Vancouver X Inn,"XT Burnaby in BC was one of the stay in all the trips taken during years of travel, business related as well as for pleasure.

164558628,VCBCX1,"Seattle, United States",2013-06-19,Vancouver X Inn,Wonderful hotel and service. We came to Burnaby to attend a wedding and really appreciated the hotel shuttle to the reception in the evening. The driver came when we called to take us back to the hotel.
234024061,VCBCX1,"Seattle, WA",2014-10-12,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed at the XT Vancouver Metrotown because events happening in the city made downtown hotels exorbitantly expensive.  We ended up being very pleased with the hotel.  Our package included parking, breakfast and wifi.  Breakfast was tasty but service was slow.  As a line formed and stretched down the hall, only one hostess was available to seat guests.  Wifi was pretty weak in our room and we had to be in the bathroom or doorway to get online.Though the hotel is away from the city center, the skytrain stops just a few blocks away and runs straight into the city.  The Metrotown mall and surrounding areas have tons of shopping choices."
152955408,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2013-02-24,Vancouver X Inn,"We got a great weekend deal on a room at the XT Metrotown in Burnaby. We wanted to go to Vancouver to sightsee, eat/drink and shop. Being savvy travelers, hopping on the skytrain to downtown Vancouver was no problem for us. It's a five minute walk from the hotel to the Skytrain station, then a 17 minute ride downtown. While the Skytrain wasn't an issue, if we return to Vancouver, we'll likely stay in a more centrally-located hotel. Two bummers- just to get a cup of coffee in the morning, we had to walk a few blocks to the Starbucks at the Metrotown Mall. Not a huge deal, just would have been nice if there was a coffee shop in the lobby or closer by. Also, the hotel is connected to the Crystal Mall, an Asian shopping center. The lobby and hallways smelled like fried Asian food the entire time we were there (morning until nighttime). Overall, room was clean and front desk was very helpful with determining directions, etc."
302021703,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2015-08-21,Vancouver X Inn,"It helps to have a XT elite status. However, this hotel is a very good property in its own ways. Located in Burnaby, BC, the XT Vancouver Metrotown is both centrally positioned within Burnaby and convenient to Vancouver proper. The room rates are substantially more reasonable in Burnaby, and the Sky Train for easy access to Vancouver is nearby. This would be excellent for either business or personal stays. Since we had access to the Executive Lounge, our breakfasts and early evening hors d'oeuvres were a plus. From rooms on the upper floors, there are great views, and the secure parking below the hotel is convenient. There are also excellent options for dining and shopping within walking distance. We would definitely return to this property when visiting anywhere in the general Vancouver, BC area."
503706018,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2017-07-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Very good hotel which, so far, has taken very good of an Hhonors Platinum member. Good at upgrades.

488615985,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2017-05-28,Vancouver X Inn,"When you look to park, finding non-valet parking is quite confusing. I went around a couple time to find parking and not all spots were accomodating without damaging my car. Next, most XTs have robes in the room. These robes make sleeping very comfortable and is a part of the brand. Third, finding the pool and workout facilities was quite difficult. There were not enough signs if you were going up to the 2nd floor by escalator or by elevator to help you to the workout facilities or pool. Lastly, after check-in the front desk forgot to give me water even though I was a XT honor member. I realized that after I saw some guests with water next the front desk. This facility lacks the simple touches that will make it from good to great."

Rooms are big, quite, nice view, well stocked.The hotel has a nice place to get a meal or just a quick coffee.  Most helpful.Hotel shares a section with a Chinese food court.  Super food, especially a place called Best Noodles, Dim Sum.  all the food court is cash only.  no problem, a cash machine is close by.A must experience, it was close to the time we were in East Asia."
429565490,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2016-10-18,Vancouver X Inn,Room was very clean. Hotel was centrally located. Easy walking distance from retail and restaurants. Staff were helpful and friendly; helpful. There is parking available; although I found it confusing because parking is shared with other business and you must park at designated color coded area. I would stay here again based on my experience.
608269209,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2018-08-19,Vancouver X Inn,We ended up here because most of the Downtown hotels were full and couldnt get the room for the dates we needed. tHis was a bargain and we loved it. Central to many activities we wanted to do. Our kids liked the shopping in the mall adjoining and there is a movie theater over there. Comfortable rooms and clean place. Loved it.
559811058,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2018-02-11,Vancouver X Inn,We go up to Vancouver quite a bit and wanted to stay in a different part of town. This was a great location near to SkyTrain and also a lot of restaurants. It allowed us to stay in a good hotel for a great price and still get downtown and to the stadium very quickly. Good coffee places and lots of international food nearby. 
430494660,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2016-10-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Very clean room, excellent front desk staff with a great sense of humor. The hotel is close to the Sky Train, malls and restaurants. Breakfast buffet had a good assortment of different foods. If I'm in the area again, I would seek this hotel for accommodations."
609222478,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2018-08-22,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel was nice and close to public transportation.  There was also a wonderful market next to the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Only problem with the hotel is that the rooms are a little dated and could use an update. 
449431086,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2017-01-04,Vancouver X Inn,"for a family has a dog of any sizes, this hotel is perfect you.  My family was very comfortable walking our doodle in the lobby, very accommodating.  In spite of a dog friendly hotel,  the hotel is very clean.  Highly recommended! "
348553497,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington",2016-02-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Recently stayed two nights at this XT.  The service was great as was the available breakfast and night snacks in the lounge.  Bed was soft, no noise and the elevators were very quick.  Good experience overall."
185256443,VCBCX1,"Seattle, Washington, United States",2013-11-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Our family spent one wonderful night at the XT Metrotown over Labor day weekend.The hotel is situated right next to the Metropolis mall in the heart of Burnaby and is connected to Crystal mall, a large Asian mall with a dingy food court and plenty of shops.Overnight garage parking in the mall is around $15, if I recall correctly.  There is also free garage parking during the day.  Once you park your car, there are many walkable options around the hotel, including the two malls mentioned.We highly recommend Isami Sushi across the street from the hotel, although it's not very kid friendly.Aside from the great location, the hotel itself is very new and clean.  The staff are friendly.  One downside is that the Wifi internet is not free.We would definitely stay here again next time we are in the Vancouver area."
314910498,VCBCX1,"Sechelt, Canada",2015-09-29,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed here for one night while my husband was at a meeting. The room was lovely. Everything was super clean! Very close to great shopping at Metrotown. Parking was easy to access and cost $11 per day.
519879079,VCBCX1,"Seogwipo, South Korea",2017-08-31,Vancouver X Inn,"Situated in the most perfect location. Next to big big mall - Metro town,sky train and Crystal mall.Staffs at reception were super nice and friendly . So happy to have at least 3 super stores to buy groceries like fruits and vegetables. With the sky train very easy to move around. You can spent the whole day hanging out in Metro town. "
428694385,VCBCX1,"Shanghai, China",2016-10-17,Vancouver X Inn,"XT used to be a five-star hotel in Asia, but this one in Vancouver more like a 3-star hotel with only three passenger lifts as seen.  However, I find its location is quite convenience and everything you need is just nearby, together with a large Metrotown mall within 5 mins walk plus a Chinese shopping center just down below the hotel.  The room rate is much more reasonable than those at downtown area, at least 50% lower.  Will stay here again if I come back to the Burnaby, as this is probably the only star hotel in the area."

Did I mind a pull out eco soft pull out sofa bed queen size rather than my king size bed booked??   Nope I am travelling alone.Got to the 18 floor saw my suite and squealed with delight. I was 10 min too late to partack of the Opal room appy's and such but the lovely hostess tried to make me take food back to my room. I really needed real food (for my not eaten  breakfast, lunch, dinner combined) ordered the asian chicken salad.....YUM and I could not finish it all.Room was lovely as was the room service and entire hotel staff. My entire trip was steller and I will retunr again and again."
244754906,VCBCX1,"Shawnigan Lake, Canada",2014-12-16,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel has all the right things but the upkeep is just surface only.   I booked in and laid down on the comforter to watch a bit of TV.   When I felt it was time to go to bed and opened the sheets on the bed - surprise - blood on the sheets and 1 pillow case.  I was stunned and after phoning the front desk they did offer a different room immediately or they would have house keeping to come up right away.  Wow, the XT Hotel. Just a note to self - never judge a book by its cover - I would have never thought in today's Heath and Safety world something like this would happen to me.   Stunned.  I am sure the hotel was as well.  I didn't sleep much that night and for me never again at this hotel.   "
409593873,VCBCX1,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",2016-08-23,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is brilliantly situated for visitors to the city, with Deer Lake Park and the Sky Train on the doorstep. There is also the whole complex for shopping in which the hotel resides - really nice! The community growing up around the hotel has a lovely atmosphere. I'd return if necessary. One necessity is the accommodation being for five of us - the hotel had no issues making this happen."
581694509,VCBCX1,"Shepherdstown, West Virginia",2018-05-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent value, and half the price of downtown hotels, even if you consider the cost of cab rides added in. However the sky train is an easy walk from the hotel, as are shopping, grocery store, and tons of great restaurants. However, the friendly, helpful staff from the front desk to the restaurant to the bellmen were what made our stay outstanding! Travelling for business can be trying, and they were fantastic, including receiving and sending packages."
376813421,VCBCX1,"Sherwood Park, Canada",2016-05-26,Vancouver X Inn,"Had a one day seminar, and booked at the metro town, as easy to get from airport, and easy to get downtown with train. Loved every moment, clean, friendly and comfortable. Would stay here again and again."
373830638,VCBCX1,"Shoreline, Washington",2016-05-17,Vancouver X Inn,"I always stay at the Metrotown XT when I'm in Vancouver area for meetings. Located close to the sky train and the mall, with plenty of parking. Rooms are quiet and in good shape, views are great from upper floors. Cannot wait for my next visit. "
153733698,VCBCX1,"Sidney, Canada",2013-03-04,Vancouver X Inn,"Our reception in the restaurant by staff who recognized us from our many years of returning made us feel more than welcome...more like a 'home away from home' experience. Since this hotel is in such a central location we choose it over many other hotels.  We take the Sky Train into the city to meet other friends, or to take in other venues.  This works really well. The restaurant is very good but  most of all  quiet.  At our age we appreciate being able to enjoy not only good food, with quality service but also good conversation.  The positive atmosphere is engendered by positive management."
177699802,VCBCX1,"Silver Spring, Maryland, United States",2013-09-18,Vancouver X Inn,"Great service, great location. I had the wonderful opportunity of spending five days at this hotel while seeing the sites of Vancouver. I also thoroughly enjoyed the Asian Market that's attached as well as some of the great little restaurants along Kingsway. Yes, this hotel is &quot;out of downtown&quot;, but it's a quick 15-20 minutes into downtown, and it's in a very quiet and comfortable neighborhood. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Vancouver or just passing through catching a cruise."
261567374,VCBCX1,"Singapore, Singapore",2015-03-24,Vancouver X Inn,"I had flown in after a 17 hour flight and boy, was I glad to check in to this hotel and my room. Modern simplicity at its best. The room and bathroom was clean and well-maintained, and pretty spacious. The bed came with loads of pillows and was super comfy, it was HEAVEN after my long flight. I've stayed in  hotels downtown which were expensive, on the cruddy side and really not worth the money. Here, you get a lovely experience and you're just minutes away from the Skytrain. It's also a really quiet and safe neighbourhood. The staff here were fantastic and genuinely friendly as well. I stayed here just 2 nights but I know I'll be back again."
335488589,VCBCX1,"Singapore, Singapore",2015-12-28,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here for 2 nights. On the first night itself we found that our room heating system is not working. On our complaint EDDY responded quickly and moved us to another room that was warm and cosy. Thank you Eddy. Location is great, near to Metropolis mall and sky train station.Rooms are nice and spacious. Breakfast is very good.Our only frustration with this hotel was their heating system and elevator that are too slow to respond to card insertion and often moved before reading the card taking person to the wrong floor.Overall, we will come back here as this is good value for money."
602249442,VCBCX1,"Singapore, Singapore",2018-08-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed in this hotel because I got a good deal as a Diamond member.  After getting there I learned that I didn't get a great deal.  The wallpaper is peeling off the walls, the &quot;executive&quot; floor for breakfast was dirty with food all over the floor.  Good location, but this hotel needs a makeover!"
444349243,VCBCX1,"Singapore, Singapore",2016-12-14,Vancouver X Inn,Rooms were cleaned well. Availability of water bottles and hot drinks in club floor was great! Hotel conceirge was helpful. Felt cheated by the taxi driver taking us to the airport - the driver forced me to pay an extra $13 as tips! 
193377713,VCBCX1,"Smithers, Canada",2014-02-07,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here after booking through hotwire.com.  We got a good rate on a good room in a good location.  Only complaints were that parking costs extra and this wasn't explained to us when we booked, or when we checked in.  We got a bill under our door the morning we left. Also, you have to pay for wireless internet, which I thought was kind of cheap.  I've stayed in many hotels less vaunted than this chain and have always had complimentary e-mail access."
507647661,VCBCX1,"Smithers, Canada",2017-07-31,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff at this location go above and beyond for each and every customer.  Friendly smiles and service every time! the rooms are nothing spectacular but always clean and fresh, the pool facilities are great for kids (not a place for swimming laps) but the bar is comfortable and the food is exceptional.  Walking distance to Metropolis and many dining options and close to skytrain and bus routes"
472207044,VCBCX1,"Smithers, Canada",2017-04-02,Vancouver X Inn,Beds were comfortable.  Room was warm (too warm). L8cation was very convenient for transportation and shopping and restaurants.  You need your room key for the elevator and you need to be very fast or you are riding the elevator more than you want.
174164319,VCBCX1,Solihull,2013-08-26,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed in a club room in August 2013 at this hotel, The room itself was good, modern and bright. I find XT rooms a bit dark and gloomy so it was nice to have a brighter room. The club lounge however was poor. XT club lounges leave a lot to be desired, this one being tight as it was a converted bedroom. Other brands have better lounges that include alcohol whereas XT charges for this. Not really worth the upgrade."
491079594,VCBCX1,south yorkshire,2017-06-06,Vancouver X Inn,"Handy location.

588202854,VCBCX1,"Southey, Canada",2018-06-17,Vancouver X Inn,"I came here because I have some business at SFU Burnaby for the next 4 nights. Located close to the Metropolis Mall and sky train station, the location is pretty good. Hotel lobby is small, but clean. Staff were helpful and accommodated my early check in. My room was on a higher floor so street noise is virtually imperceptible.  The fitness centre is small with only 1 elliptical, 1 bike, 2 treadmills, a rower and some free weights - wish they would expand or offer a discount with GoodLife down the block.  Pool area could also use a refresh as pool was small, hot tub was ok, and they had a kiddie pool.  Havenâ€™t tried the restaurant yet, but willing to give it a look"
422562960,VCBCX1,"Springfield, Missouri",2016-09-26,Vancouver X Inn,This XT surpassed our expectations.  Extremely helpful staff. The business center had everything we needed to check in for our upcoming flights.  The pool area was the perfect place to sit in the sun on a cool day. 
525879821,VCBCX1,"Springfield, Virginia",2017-09-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Every one of the staff members were extremely friendly for the following reasons:1) Since my father was with me, guest services voluntarily offered me a double bed room with a city view even though I booked for a king bed.  2) I thought my TV was not working.  The maintenance guy was on his way out of the building (I think he may have clocked out already), but he still came to take a look at the problem."
177611234,VCBCX1,"Spruce Grove, Canada",2013-09-17,Vancouver X Inn,Always stay here when on business in Burnaby. Hotel always delivers excellent service on all levels. Breakfast in room is fantastic! And the restaurant on the 3rd floor has excellent menu and food. Rooms are quiet and just a few steps from the best mall in the Vancouver are Metrotown.
622213257,VCBCX1,"Squamish, Canada",2018-10-04,Vancouver X Inn,"At first I thought I would be disappointed because my room assignment was directly off the elevator facing a gigantic construction site.  However,  the windows had excellent sound proofing and it was entertaining watching the work going on."
557779443,VCBCX1,"St. Albert, Canada",2018-02-01,Vancouver X Inn,In Burnaby for the day but ended up needing to spend the night. The location is very easy to access from the sky train station (1 block). A large mall was across the street that allowed me to pick up some items for the unexpected layover. Front desk staff were very helpful and provided a complimentary  overnight grooming kit. The room was not inexpensive but price was competitive to the other comparable options in Burnaby. The food in the restaurant/bar was good but the server could have used some help.
394960535,VCBCX1,"St. Catharines, Canada",2016-07-20,Vancouver X Inn,"Great hotel, close to Major shopping Mall Sky Train and Bus service. It is also close to different Restaurants. All these destinations are well within walking distance. There is also a great Market beside the Hotel selling beautiful fresh produce."
218377846,VCBCX1,"St. Catharines, Canada",2014-07-29,Vancouver X Inn,"The XT Vancouver Metrotown was a great choice for my stay in Burnaby.  It was clean, quiet and accessible to transportation and shopping. I felt secure at this location.  It was a pleasant experience."

622433079,VCBCX1,"St. George, Utah",2018-10-05,Vancouver X Inn,First time to visit this hotel. We enjoy traveling with XT because of their high standards and also the rewards as a diamond member are always great.  the hotel upgraded us to a nice suite over looking the city from the top floor.  This is a great location that has almost everything you need. The hotel is at least 20 years old but well maintained. The second largest mall and Canada is located next door. Central transportation hub is also located at the small and it is convenient to get all over Vancouver. The staff were amazing and very friendly. We really enjoyed the secular launch with all of the goodies and the wonderful people working there   Will be back again next year and will stay here again 
203911099,VCBCX1,"St. John&#39;s, Canada",2014-05-03,Vancouver X Inn,Spent a week here on business and the hotel is comfortable and quiet. There is some construction in the area but I did not hear a thing in my room which was nicely appointed and a very good value. The hotel is close to the skytrain which allows easy access to many areas around Vancouver including the waterfront and is right across from a mall complex. There are several restaurants within walking distance which also provide a good value.
412719698,VCBCX1,"St. Petersburg, Florida",2016-08-30,Vancouver X Inn,This hotel is not in Vancouver but it is easily access but the sky train which is also a cheap way to get around. We had no problems using and saw all that we had planned. We also did the hop of and off trolley which is a must to get to know more about Vancouver .  The staff at the hotel was very knowable and helped us to get sround . Unless you need to stay in town this hotel was very reasonable and a good alternative 
212795292,VCBCX1,"Stafford, United Kingdom",2014-06-30,Vancouver X Inn,"Friendly staff greeted us.  Breakfast was ok during our stay. The gym was a little small and appeared to be an after thought, but wasn't busy. The room was a good size and the bed quite comfortable.  The car park was quite awkward to negotiate. Overall a pleasant stay"
294268686,VCBCX1,"Stockholm, Sweden",2015-07-30,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is pretty nice but it's not downtown. We spent a few nights before a cruise and then spent another week downtown afterwards so for us it was fine to spend the first few days in Burnaby and do some shopping at the mall. Thr neighborhood is safe, and had some ok reasturants closeby, like the trattoria and cactus clib cafe. The mall is huge. It's about 20 minutes on the skytrain to downtown and we had no problem getting there from the airport and to the cruise since it's close to the station.The breakfast was included and actually really good, with fresh berries and bagels etc. The rooms were fairly large and the view of a construction site was at least a big hit with our 2-year old. Same goes for the kids pool which was perfect for him."
256375139,VCBCX1,"Stonewall, Manitoba",2015-02-25,Vancouver X Inn,I was recently at a conference and stayed at this location. The check in is very easy and the staff very helpful in terms of finding us a local restaurant. We wanted to sight see on our day of checkout and were provided a late checkout along with luggage storage. This location is great as there is access to the Skytrain.
427732239,VCBCX1,"Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom",2016-10-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Wonderful, incredibly helpful reception staff not only got us checked in quickly but helped us plan our whole visit.

593383424,VCBCX1,"Strongsville, Ohio",2018-07-05,Vancouver X Inn,"The location and the hotel were perfect for our 3-day holiday in Vancouver. Close to shops, restaurants and metro station. We were upgraded to a corner suite, which was a pleasant surprise. The breakfast buffet was good (acceptable). Would definitely stay here again."
628800727,VCBCX1,"Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania",2018-10-27,Vancouver X Inn,"The Burnaby Metrotown XT was a lovely hotel, even though serious construction was in process across the street, making access to entrance sometimes difficult. However, the hotel was clean, safe, and well situated with access by public transportation to Downtown Vancouver. The personnel, including wait staff at the hotel restaurant, were friendly, helpful (often above and beyond), and very accommodating. The food at the restaurant was probably the best hotel food we have ever had. We had a suite, which easily accommodated 3 of us. We were there for a Hearties Family Reunion, where everything was very well planned and executed. That added to the pleasure of our stay."
385929923,VCBCX1,"Sugar Grove, North Carolina",2016-06-25,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at this hotel before and after a scheduled cruise to Alaska.  Hotel is very clean, staff are friendly and helpful, and overall in good shape.  It's convenient to shopping at a large shopping mall across the street.  The one knock against the hotel is the lack of convenience to the ports/downtown Vancouver.  No shuttle service to the ports or airport.  I had mapped the distance of the hotel from downtown and it was not that far, but traffic makes it about a 30+ minute drive.  There is a sky train located across the street, which serves well if you don't have baggage.  My suggestion is to stay if your business does not require the cruise terminal."
534051853,VCBCX1,Surrey,2017-10-18,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is comfortable, clean, well maintained. It's decor style is a bit dated and service and feel is typical of a large chain, polite but impersonal.Noise levels are pretty awful with major building work going on across the road starting at 7am every day - not great when you're trying to manage jet lag.Bar area is busy and a nice plan to have a relaxed drink and bite to eat.  Hotel is well located for sky train just a few minutes away. Lots of local type shops and Chinese and Japanese  eating places on the doorstep."
240923069,VCBCX1,"Surrey, BC, Canada",2014-11-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Ed Jaskula and his staff are terrific!  They work hard to ensure that each guest enjoys a spotlessly clean, comfortable and welcoming environment.  We have booked large functions there in the past as well as simple overnight getaways.  The service is excellent, the food is exceptional, and some of the menu choices are simply amazing.  I do not hesitate to recommend a stay at this property.  The only drawback is the congested underground parking, but that is easily solved by using the valet parking service at the front entrance."
290008659,VCBCX1,"Surrey, BC, Canada",2015-07-13,Vancouver X Inn,"The property is well appointed with great amenities in the hotel and the Metrotown Shopping Center just a short walk across the street.  The skytrain station is also close by so you don't need to use your car to get around unless you choose to do so.  Everyone on staff is friendly and goes out of their way to ensure that you are having a great experience.  This is not the cheapest hotel in the area, but it is one of the best bargains."
188420067,VCBCX1,"surrey, Canada",2013-12-23,Vancouver X Inn,"From the time we entered the grounds of the hotel we were met by the Valet parking staff who started our weekend get away in the right way.  It only got better.  The reception desk was staffed by friendly helpful personal and when taken to our room we found it to be well above what I expected.  The room was clean, well decorated and very comfortable.  Breakfast was second to none.  A wonderful stay from start to finish.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to feel pampered."
503271888,VCBCX1,"Surrey, Canada",2017-07-18,Vancouver X Inn,"Our car was forced open inside hotel basement parking. The manager said it happens like every 3 months. And yet , they don't at least try to come up with a solution. The parking is not free. And it has an electronic gate. Must be an inside job since there is a serial burglary going on.  Must be safer to park in Metrotown Mall but it doesn't make sense if you are booked in the hotel."
373096185,VCBCX1,"Surrey, Canada",2016-05-15,Vancouver X Inn,"I had the Sunday Brunch buffet while in the hotel for a meeting and was very impressed. While it was a bit on the expensive side, the selection and food quality was amazing. I guess you get what you pay for"
574648328,VCBCX1,Sweden,2018-04-20,Vancouver X Inn,A Multicultural environment that helps you not to be homesick. The staff have such a friendly attitude and always willing to serve. I really appreciate the comfort I received. The Asian restaurants are awesome! 
215260853,VCBCX1,"Sydney, Australia",2014-07-13,Vancouver X Inn,"The room was extremely clean and tidy, the executive lounge is very small and is hard to get a seat in the morning for breakfast. The location is handy to the nearby mall and the rail system. We booked tickets for a tour for the next day, the concierge stated he would book hem in the morning And call us to confirm, we waited until 10am. We waited in the room until 10am for the call and there was no call. I went down to the concierge desk and enquirer and found out that the tour was booked out and they had tried calling our room but there was no reply???? We had missed breakfast but the concierge on duty organised for us to have breakfast in the restaurant and he would get the manager to contact us to apologise. There was no call or apology from the manager. A waste of part of the day waiting around when we could have organised another tour. I have over 150 stays In XT properties and have never encountered such poor service."
459050310,VCBCX1,"Sydney, Australia",2017-02-12,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here over the period leading to and after New Year's Eve.  The hotel is modern, comfortable, well equipped and the staff were fantastic.  The New Year's Eve function was terrific fun and well organised, and the views towards Vancouver from the higher floors were superb - especially when there was a huge dump of snow on New Year's Eve itself.  A good hotel and great service.  However, Metrotown is around a 30 minute drive from Vancouver downtown and all the things it has to offer, and whilst there is a good train service very nearby, if you are coming to visit and see Vancouver there are better located hotels and we found ourselves regularly commuting into town for what we wanted - it was OK because we had a car but it added complexity and meant I couldn't drink in the evenings because I had to drive to and from the various things we wanted to do downtown (like Roger's Arena and the hockey)."
235451634,VCBCX1,"Sydney, Australia",2014-10-20,Vancouver X Inn,"Did ''Toddamy'' stay in the same hotel? ''Centrally Located  to the downtown area''?Actually, I was surprised and VERY disappointed to see just how far out this hotel was and wondered why they would build way out there. We stayed 2 nights prior to taking a cruise and it cost $75 and almost an hour by taxi to get from this hotel to the shipping terminal in Canada Place, which IS right downtown. There is the train but about 1km away through shopping centre, across main roads, over stairs, etc - way too much hassle with luggage.The hotel itself was nice enough and we were upgraded (being Diamond) to a quite-nice suite. The usual tired, miserable, XT bathroom though."
315433473,VCBCX1,"Sydney, Australia",2015-10-01,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is not a  5 star XT standard but i found it very cozy  clean and very handy to metro town a big shopping centre just opposite in fact and also very handy to Sky train, so you can take the train downtown... The staff were very friendly and very helpful, i will stay in this hotel again next time I visit Vancouver..."
432551497,VCBCX1,SYLVAN LAKE,2016-10-28,Vancouver X Inn,"We booked the Executive King Suite for the space and the access to the Opal Lounge. The suite was nice, what I would expect for a $200+ room in Vancouver but a little small and dated. As for executive, the only thing that seemed above any other room was the ice bucket, it was pretty. The Opal Lounge was anything but quiet as the hotel was fully booked, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the food was good. The front desk staff were wonderful, the concierge was fantastic, fun and friendly. I would definitely recommend valet parking. I would definitely stay here again just because of the staff!"
332780481,VCBCX1,"Tacoma, WA",2015-12-14,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel is of XT luxury level with executive lounge and services. It is a good location for a conference or business meeting. We stayed with family in 2 rooms. Both were very nice and comfortable. The executive lounge served breakfast and evening snacks (light meal). Lovely views of the territory.Parking is included. Be aware that due to the garage being shared with a mall there will be heavy traffic during business hours.Close proximity to 2 large malls. Easy access to Vancouver and US border. 
249705968,VCBCX1,"Tampa, Florida",2015-01-17,Vancouver X Inn,"I booked this hotel primarily because it was a XT on the Vancouver Metro, so I could easily get to events at the Convention Center and not pay $300+ US a night to be walking distance (my nightly rate was a third the downtown Hampton Inn).  Aside from the benefits of a XT business hotel, it's located near a major shopping center in Burnaby - and it sits on top of a Chinese shopping center ala Taipei!    So, dinner every night was Chinese market eats (the kiosks have great noodle bowls and pearl milk teas) at a fraction of the cost of a harborside restaurant.   A secondary benefit is greater proximity to the Vancouver airport, so in and out on early/late flights is more convenient.   Only downside is distance to downtown - it's in Burnaby - but if the Metro gets you proximal to you destination (and there are two different lines in from Metrotown, so there are lots of trains) it's worthwhile."
601252113,VCBCX1,"Tampa, Florida",2018-07-30,Vancouver X Inn," This hotel is an excellent location. Itâ€™s close to all the important sites in and around Vancouver. Easy access to the airport, ferry terminal, and downtown. Walking distance to the skytrain. Very close to shopping. Short drive to all the local sites including Stanley Park, downtown Vancouver, grouse Mountain, northern Vancouver, and more. The staff at this location were amazing. Had an excellent experience with the staff including Siman, Anthony, Kris, and Sumeel.  "
324413396,VCBCX1,"Tampa, Florida",2015-11-04,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed here for a preliminary stop on our way to a cruise of Vancouver. The staff, top to bottom, did everything that you can imagine to make our stay exceptional. This hotel is three blocks from the Metro, which gets you to most places in Vancouver for approx. 8 dollars a day. They have a stay and cruise package that included a shuttle to the cruise ship terminal. Very much recommend this property."
413592116,VCBCX1,Teaneck NJ,2016-09-01,Vancouver X Inn,"I guess we expected more from a XT! The rooms and the hotel itself were rather disappointing. It also was also two long blocks from the Skytrain, so baggage carriers beware! Though the staff was most courteous, there was little that was special, except the location. What we discovered on our own, without being told by staff, was that the hotel was smack in the middle of feeling like you are in Asia. We were able to walk out the second floor into a fascinating mall with markets and shops that barely showed a word in English. This made up for the mediocrity of the hotel. Great area to explore! "
604393450,VCBCX1,"Tehran, Iran",2018-08-08,Vancouver X Inn,We were there one week ago It was very nice and comfortable hotel The weather was warm but we ate a very cold detox water it was very enjoyable for usThe room was clean and the bed was comfortable too we booked a suite It didnâ€™t have any sleeper but we called to housekeeping and then they brought for us The hotel was well placed just ten minutes to Vancouver downtown by metro and there was Metro town shopping mall which only needed 5 minutes by walk and there was a good food court in shopping mall.Mr Massimo ( if I remember his name correctly) was very helpful person and the other staff was kind
381516390,VCBCX1,"Terrace, Canada",2016-06-10,Vancouver X Inn,I needed a robe for the pool/hot tub. A simple question to guest services and a robe arrived in minutes. Same for a sluggish remote. Even the complimentary towels by the pool were well stocked. And shopping location can't be beat!
455807785,VCBCX1,"Terrace, Canada",2017-01-29,Vancouver X Inn,Great stay with good food services.  The staff were very helpful and the location is easy to access by skytrain or vehicle.  Located right at a major shopping centre and multiple eating establishments near by
289722723,VCBCX1,"Thousand Oaks, California",2015-07-15,Vancouver X Inn,"Nine of us including four grandkids, two grandparents and three parents shared four rooms. All were clean, quiet and comfortable and well stocked with useful amenities. Staff was terrific in many ways and assisted me in joining the XT Hhonors program. Breakfast was to typical XT highest standards. Pools area was clean and wonderful fun for the kids. It was a great stay for two days and we'll be back next time we're in Vancouver."
528198390,VCBCX1,"Thousand Oaks, California",2017-09-28,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is not downtown and even though it's 'steps' away from the Crystal Mall, everything there is in chinese so if you don't know that language you only want to go if you are practicing for when you go to China."
298657978,VCBCX1,"Thunder Bay, Canada",2015-08-12,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel experience was great, as was the location. The restaurant food costs were quite high, we thought, but the quality and service were great. The fish chowder was fabulous! I would recommend this to others."
350437201,VCBCX1,"Tokyo, Japan",2016-02-23,Vancouver X Inn,Good location. Can walk to the big mall and enhoy shopping. Close to the sky-train station so it is very convenient to go downtown (water-front). Just 30min. Also Good servicve and Comfortable room. Very kind concierge who told us the sight-seeing spots with map.
215279898,VCBCX1,"Tokyo, Japan",2014-07-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Great staff. comfortable beds. And beyond that, nothing special. Rooms are outdated; wifi isn't free; very &quot;90s&quot; in look. Rooms are not well equipped. Air-con is loud and not consistent. Breakfast is good."
166122898,VCBCX1,tomeller,2013-07-01,Vancouver X Inn,"not a bad hotel if you stay inside.  The hotel is across teh road from a very large mall, but also across the street from a very large brothel and several sex shops.  Room Service food was hit and miss, cleaning crew did ok but frequently missed little things."
486203663,VCBCX1,"Toms River, New Jersey",2017-05-21,Vancouver X Inn,This location was perfect for shopping and very close to the train to go downtown .  The staff is Friendly and Helpful.... I would recommend this location for anyone who wants to be quite but yet only a short train ride to the Metropolitan Area
344629721,VCBCX1,Toronto,2016-02-02,Vancouver X Inn,"XT is right across the street from the Metrotown Mall and a ton of different restaurants all within walking distance. There is a great little part in behind where you can watch people exercising and doing tai chi, walk or jog the path, or hit up the little food court for exotic food.The parking is a bit of a challenge and it's not about the abundance of it - if you can't stay on the first level, there is a tight hairpin turn with which you are fighting on coming parking traffic exiting. Patience is a virtue.Overall, I've stayed here many times and it's so convenient to have the mall across the street...you won't run out of great restaurants to hit up. My office is on the other side of Burnaby and the traffic is never too heavy at any time of the day. Clean, very courteous staff, smallish gym, great value when it's on promotion."
161910812,VCBCX1,Toronto,2013-05-26,Vancouver X Inn,Stayed here for a week and was pleased with the service and rooms.The hotel has been maintained and is very clean (housekeeping is doing a great job).Very good location if you don't have a car as it is close to the Skytrain and the biggest mall in British Columbia.  Very good restaurants are nearby and the hotel restaurant is also very good.  Breakfast is your standard fare and is also good.
157725422,VCBCX1,Toronto,2013-04-14,Vancouver X Inn,"As a XT honors, the room was upgraded to a suite style on 1505. Walk in to a living area and office table.  The right side is a washroom and right Bessie was the bedroom.  Clean and spacious with two LG TVs.  I really liked that it was connected to crystal mall and a Asian food court for light snakes or full meals. Breakfast is also available downstairs."
304392184,VCBCX1,toronto,2015-08-28,Vancouver X Inn,"This place is well situated beside a giant....really....giant mall,  if that's your thing. Welcoming staff, clean comfortable rooms with fantastic beds and linens. There's construction nearby but heard virtually no noise. If you pop for the top floor breakfast you'll find it well worth it. Standard room wifi is a little slow."
510720732,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2017-08-09,Vancouver X Inn,"My husband and I were so excited to be staying at a XT based on what we knew of the 5 star hotel. We checked in late at night and the service person was not pleasant. We had an infant, were exhausted, noone helped with our luggage, and to make matters worse a smoker was on hotel property lighting up. The service person didn't seem to care and did not explain how to use the hotel elevators with the door card. The hotel requires some serious renovations. The rest of the XT staff were pleasant and friendly. The hotel is close to Metrotown sky train station and Metropolis shopping mall. It takes less than 30 minutes to get to downtown Vancouver. Overall this Hotel is not worth the price so you're better off at the Holiday Inn."
419365890,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2016-09-16,Vancouver X Inn,"From the time I drove in, the door person was extremely helpful,  and your staff at the front counter still providing remarkably unbelievable customer service and appreciation.    Special thanks to Adonica for taking care of my reservation  I honestly thought/expect that the customer service level might have dropped, from past based on the pure act that staying at such a high level is sometimes unsustainable. Kudos, to you and your staff for keeping that level of service.  Iâ€™ve already been asked based on my post where I was staying, without hesitation â€œXT Vancouver  Metrotownâ€.  You are a role model for the entire XT Worldwide chain.  Please send this message Higher up, This XT really needs to be recognized."
216303689,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2014-07-19,Vancouver X Inn,"This is not the most excellent hotel in the world, but if your business takes you to Metrotown, it's the best thing around. The rooms are big, clean and have most of the things you need. Like if you happen to need an empty fridge, there is one of those. The gym is a horrible little room with a few machines, but if you go at a non-peak time you'll have it to yourself.The restaurant and bar are nice enough and there is a patio. Breakfast is a buffet or you can order off the menu.  The meeting rooms are large and spacious. But what makes this place worth it is the staff. From the banquets team to the bartender to the guy who made the projector work, they were friendly, helpful and totally accommodating."
305799261,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2015-09-01,Vancouver X Inn,"I was laying over in Vancouver for 2 nights before heading to Whistler on business. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff were very pleasant and accommodating. The location is interesting, there is an Asian mall connected to the hotel and the Metrotown Centre nearby. Downtown Vancouver, the airport and North/West Vancouver are each a half hour away by car. The cost to stay downtown is prohibitive so there is a fair trade off to this quiet, comfortable but slightly out of the way location. Breakfast was excellent, as a Gold Member i was entitled to the cold buffet, with a $4 option to upgrade to hot items. Service in the dining room was terrific."
161549743,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2013-05-22,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed at the XT Metrotown for a few days for a friends wedding.  The room was nice and spacious.  We received a complimentary newspaper every morning and had free access to the internet and printer in the foyer.  The skytrain and a major mall were only a 5 minute walk away.  The sky train was about $3.00 to get into the city but took about 30 minutes to get there.  The sky train was very convenient to get around to the major attractions.  The room rate was quite affordable but the hotel restaurant was a little overpriced.  I'd suggest taking a car or walk to the mall to get something better to eat.Overall a nice hotel for the price.
437261529,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2016-11-14,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at this hotel three nights with my sister. Parking is $13.00 a night. Since our booking was done on Priceline we didn't get free wifi in our room only in the lobby. We have booked many times through a third party vendor and have never had an issue. This was the first time either one of us were denied a service that we have diamond XT membership privileges. The room was comfortable and reasonably quiet. Our room was not cleaned on our last day even though we left at 9:30am and returned at 9:00pm. The location is very good, close to the mall and sky train. Not sure I would stay again as I feel this is more of a 3.5 star hotel."
504486757,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2017-07-22,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel located in Burnaby is outside the downtown core but only steps from the train line.   We drove and trained into downtown and the train was much faster.   Rooms are modern and extremely clean.  The highlight of this property is the staff.  They truly go above and beyond.   Front fast was great, breakfast service (and food)was excellent and Pol and Jose at the lounge bar were not only helpful with drinks but gave great sightseeing advice ( thanks guys). All in all another excellent XT experience. "
251674741,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2015-01-29,Vancouver X Inn,"I had the good pleasure to be staying here for a week on business.  Although the hotel is older, it is very clean and staff are exceptionally helpful in all capacities.  A great location, easily accessed by public transportation.  Because of it being an older property, there was very occasionally some sound transference from the neighbouring room/floor, but this did not disrupt my time in any way.  Would not hesitate to recommend this property and would welcome the opportunity to stay there in the future."
424872288,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2016-10-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Though in the suburbs, this hotel made me enjoy the area I was staying in. The room was large, clean, and had a nice view of the mountains. I had a XT Points number and that apparently allowed me entry into the lounge, which had a buffet breakfast and dinner they call it hors d'oeuvres but it definitely qualified as dinner. The hotel was also right across the street from the SkyTrain, and next to an enormous mall, and attached to a large Asian-styled mall. This big hotel was a rare treat."
196083022,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2014-03-03,Vancouver X Inn,"We were in Vancouver for a sporting event and used this hotel to house our team and their families. The service was excellent and the hotel was great value for the money. I would highly recommend it.  They were very helpful from start to finish- during the planning of our trip, and while we were there.  They even had special events in the hotel during the Olympics.  They had great facilities and were very good value for a reasonable cost.  The food in their restaurant was also excellent."
207959192,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2014-05-29,Vancouver X Inn,"Great rooms, excellent service, wonderfully convenient! Spent a week here during a conference and found this to be a very comfortable place to stay. Connected directly to a mall (nothing special) but great for picking up necessities or hitting up a quick food court snack. Restaurants were very pricey but good service. Rooms are modern, comfortable and quiet. Great bar/lounge with a VERY charming bartender! No matter why you're visiting, this hotel is a excellent choice!"
168846323,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2013-07-24,Vancouver X Inn,"The XT at Metrotown is only a 20min train ride from downtown Vancouver. We picked it because of the price. I was quite conservative with my expectations. Our experience was very good. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and modern. The only negative is the Wifi is not free, though there is cabled internet for free. Overall, I would return here again. It's a great alternative to downtown Vancounver hotels at a very competitive price."
172134065,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2013-08-13,Vancouver X Inn,"I stay here frequently when I go to Vancouver for business.  Staff is always very friendly.  Hotel is always very clean, with a good fitness center.  As a gold member, they always give free breakfast coupons and there are always bottles of water in the room.  It is too bad XT keeps raising their requirements to maintain high status in their hotel program as it has cost them alot of my business but this place remains a staple because it is so consistent."
194913791,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2014-02-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my family. Overall, our stay was enjoyable.Pros: - Clean, quiet room. - Close to Mall and SkyTrain. - The staff was generally quite accommodating.Cons: - Snobby front desk service: we were frowned upon for having booked our room through      Priceline...then why make yourselves available through Priceline? - Hotel doesn't offer free in-room WiFi; it's only available in the lobby. - The gym is poorly equipped for a 4-star hotel."
238292356,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2014-11-03,Vancouver X Inn,"I travel up to Vancouver frequently for business, and I was thrilled to find this hotel a couple stays ago.  It is closer to my business and it now my go to hotel.  It is always clean and comfortable.  I feel safe during my stay and the staff is very professional.  There are some great restaurants close by, or the restaurants in the hotel and room service are great options as well.  All in all, a great location, great service, and a great hotel."
628990560,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2018-10-27,Vancouver X Inn,Best accommodation for business stay that I have experienced. I travel constantly around the globe on work assignments and it is always a pleasure to be assigned work in Burnaby so that I can stay at this clean and pleasant hotel where all the staff treat me like a respected member of their family.It is the people behind the organization that always make the biggest difference! Thank you for the bottom of my heart for making me feel special!
149724490,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2013-01-15,Vancouver X Inn,"This is one of the top XT properties in the portfolio and my absolute favourite in BC- I stay here every time i come to Vancouver.  The staff are excellent and the location and building are perfect.  The only issue was no wireless interet which they installed in 2012 making it perfect.  Diamond Members love the lounge on the top floor- great personal service, try to say mid week for the Sushi night!."
200957012,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2014-04-13,Vancouver X Inn,"We enjoy the quality and service. The front desk staff was polite. The reservfation response was instant even though the news was not what we want: because we booked through Expedia, we lose our daily breakfast of the promotion code, and we lose all our Aeroplan miles for our stay. We will come back again may be booking directly not through Expedia (we don't want to lose our benefits).Fred and Lina"
369605267,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2016-05-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Hotel was conveniently located. Nearby malls, shopping centre , restaurants. Staff was extremely kind and room was very clean. Although i had some reservations toward drinking coffee from the coffee maker in the room, didn't seem very clean according to me hence i rated one less for &quot;Room Cleanliness&quot;. I stayed at this hotel for the day and enjoyed was pleased."
551368047,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2018-01-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed for two night business stay. Good value (first week of year- expect some price pressure from upstart competition a block away). Bed XT standard and WR, soft goods and furniture in good shape. Good working desk and chair, with reliable wifi and plenty of outlets. Carpet starting to show its age. Did not use pool or fitness room but they looked appealing. "
540219260,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2017-11-11,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed for two nights, was a good stay. Staff are friendly and helpful. Location is amazing, there is a large mall and the Skytrain to Vancouver nearby. The room is fine, nice work area, beds comfy and WIFI works fine.A real surprise is the restaurant, good food and good value.The gym is small, but there is a GoodLife gym nearby.I would recommend."
369096650,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2016-04-30,Vancouver X Inn,Price for the hotel was great. Got an amazing rate. Service was prompt and fast checkin and checkout. Staff was not overly friendly but they were there when I needed them. Gym was good and the restaurant had a prompt service. Room vas very big with 2 queen beds. Overall a pleasant stay and I would recommend it if you need to be in Burnaby. 
454225085,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2017-01-23,Vancouver X Inn,Overall great stay. hotel is well situated. Upgraded my room upon arrival. Clean room. Quiet and secure. Breakfast was good in their restaurant although I had to wait a bit to get seated as they were short on staff for breakfast. I have stayed here many times and that was the first time it happened so maybe it was a one time thing.
379073034,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2016-06-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed 1 night for a business meeting.The room and meeting room were adequate and well maintained.However, give the cost, I would expect more. The staff were fantastic and extremely friendly.However, the reason for my rating is strictly attributed to the cost and the constant mickle and diming at this hotel."
530926688,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2017-10-07,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a great location! Across the street from Metropolis Mall (450+ shops) and Crystal Mall (Asian Mall). Rates for rooms and parking were reasonable. Large rooms, clean and simple amenities. Quick check in, friendly staff. Steps away from Skytrain if you want to go downtown."
211786635,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2014-06-23,Vancouver X Inn,Reservation is quite professional. The room is neat and clean. The welcome message is sweet. Breakfest is fairly good. You can feel the passion and hard working from their staffs.  Overall it's great hotel. The XT brand deserves the reputation.
567862261,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2018-03-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Hotel smells, broken down, good breakfast buffet. Loud neighbours, minimum noise separation. Elevator annoying sends you to wrong floors and was broken entire time. very strong smell from restaurants next door. friendly staff. parking expensive."
261963346,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2015-03-26,Vancouver X Inn,I've stayed in this hotel a few times over the past year and every time the staff was amazing. A special thanks to Joseph who shuttled me to my work locations and to Benjamin who helped me deal with a refrigerator which kept freezing my lunch!
343619627,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2016-01-29,Vancouver X Inn,Hotel staff were very helpful. The small fridge in my room froze my food and they were very helpful in compensating and also working to fix the fridge. I know it's not a big deal but when you travel a lot it can make a really big difference.
446896851,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2016-12-27,Vancouver X Inn,A clean and comfortable stay...friendly staff...always a pleasure. I stay 2  or 3 times per year and it is always the same. Good access to restaurants and great shopping at that mall if you are a shopper. Also good access to the sky train. 
470754734,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2017-03-27,Vancouver X Inn,Perfect location for work.  Restaurant staff was EXCELLENT!  Overall the hotel met/exceeded expectations.   Room was quiet and well equipped for my weeks stay.  Super close to mall/grocery store with lots of food choices nearby
196383459,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2014-03-05,Vancouver X Inn,Good place to stay for business meetings or if need to be in that area. Otherwise it is out of the way. Not too many good restaurants around. Food in the hotel is ok - bit pricy but service is ok. All in all rates a 7 out of 10
424056783,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2016-09-30,Vancouver X Inn,"Unfortunately, I was led to believe this hotel was nearer to the center of Downtown Vancouver.  It is at least a 30 minute commute by SkyTrain.  XT calls this property Metrotown...they should change the name to Out of Town!"
401878660,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Canada",2016-08-05,Vancouver X Inn,Excellent choice Hotel in midtown area of Vancouver with easy access to all shopping avenue. Hotel have underground parking and valet service for guest . Easy access to Hwy to travel to all tourist destination. 
230145562,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Ontario",2014-09-21,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at this XT in Burnaby for a business over several days in September 2014.  This is my first time at this particular XT.  This hotel reminded me of a Holiday Inn in terms of decor, quality of furnishings and layout of the room.  I had a 1 bedroom suite with a master bed.  While the room was tidy it was very dated in terms of decor and furnishings....late seventies or early eighties.  Very basic.   I believe this place needs an update very soon.  The fitness centre on the 2nd floor is small but not any different in size than those of other hotels in this category.  I did eat at the restaurant for dinner one night and it wasn't too bad.  I would probably not stay here the next time I am in this part of the world."
211173620,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Ontario",2014-06-19,Vancouver X Inn,"A perfect stay over Fathers Day. I really liked this hotel, great location, close to transit, abundant underground parking  for a fee, well trained and friendly staff, and comfortable, well maintained accommodations   Most importantly, the hotel is adjacent to the Metrotown Shopping Plaza."
403041798,VCBCX1,"Toronto, Ontario",2016-08-08,Vancouver X Inn,This trip is really niceã€‚like helping me call the taxi and in room dinner is so great. Also the early check in help me solve a lot of questions. Anyways. Thanks for XT service for me. And i guess this my best choice for my trip!

440024521,VCBCX1,"Trail, British Columbia",2016-11-25,Vancouver X Inn,The Metrotown XT is one of my favorite hotels. The staff are fantastic. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. The restaurant and lounge have great food and excellent wait staff. I love staying here. It feels like home.

290011784,VCBCX1,"troy, United States",2015-07-13,Vancouver X Inn,great hotel with spectacular views of one of world's great cities but pathetic fitness room and tiny pool for such a big hotel. I really value these things. the hotel room though was excellent. so depends what u are looking for. It is also very close to sky train that saves u needing to drive a car in the awful Vancouver traffic.
415330583,VCBCX1,"Tucson, Arizona",2016-09-05,Vancouver X Inn,Front desk personnel were exceptional. Rm 930 is a corner room overlooking the park.  Everything worked in the room and it was spacious.  Th detailed local map provided by the front desk was invaluable as we had a longer stay than normal and used to for local shopping.  Easy walk to the Metrotown Skytrain.  25 minutes to the last stop which is the Vancouver waterfront.  The town of Burnaby should not be overlooked.   &quot;Fitness Center&quot; as labeled by XT is really a small room with 5 aerobic machines and some free weights.  Very crowded 630 to 8 a.m.    Opal Lounge is small but adequate.  The breakfast is very good.   Alcohol in the lounge is quite expensive. There is an alcohol tax and XT charges by the ounce for wine and spirits.  Go to a nearby store on the map they give you.   Overall good value for the experience.  USD was trading at .78  to the Canadian dollar at the time we stayed there.
466985202,VCBCX1,"Tucson, Arizona",2017-03-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Great hotel, clean, staff are great. Had a corner room of view! Pros outweigh the cons. Cons are: Only 4 machines in the workout room.... Wait staff in the restaurant are super slow. Nice, but slow. It's connected to some funky mall, and it's in a great location. Overall I would stay there again."
224498994,VCBCX1,"Tucson, Arizona",2014-08-26,Vancouver X Inn,There are not many hotels around the Burnaby area and I haven't stayed in other hotels to draw a comparision. Overal this is a pretty decent hotel with all the amenities of a mid-big size hotel. Dinner menu is pretty well balanced and dishes are great. Shepard pie is a must try!
345318390,VCBCX1,"Tumbler Ridge, Canada",2016-02-05,Vancouver X Inn,"All of the staff: front desk, concierge, room service, restaurant, valet and cleaning  was terrifically friendly and professional; I can't say enough about their smiles and humour and graciousness.  The location is great, with access to shopping, sky train, restaurants, and city walks at your door.  Views from the higher rooms are beautiful."
234708957,VCBCX1,"Umhlanga Rocks, South Africa",2014-10-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Great location for a Business traveller. not much to do in the area for Leisure traveller, so would not book it for this. a good shopping mall close by. Very good personalised service from the staff especially in the bar, really good food."
418075001,VCBCX1,United States,2016-09-13,Vancouver X Inn,"Well appointed, clean and comfortable hotel.  Parking in underground garage offers a safe and secure city option.  I was pleased to see two electric vehicle chargers, free for hotel guests.  One is for Tesla, the other is a standard level 2 ESVE, and are fairly new additions.  Easy drive to downtown, or one block from the elevated train platform and Mall Metropolis at Metrotown, which takes you downtown for $1.75.  Some construction across the street, but it should not discourage you from staying here.  Close walk to two different grocery stores for snacks or a bottle of wine from the BC liquor store (room has a bottle opener).  The only disappointing feature was as a XT gold member we were not extended access to the executive lounge, which at this location is only open to diamond members."
529777331,VCBCX1,United States,2017-10-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Tucked in the middle of Burnaby, this XT facility will soon be in the middle of the action.    A two block walk from the Metrotown SkyTrain Station, a grocery store within walking distance, as well as a couple of eating establishments.  Close to Central Park (Kingsway/Imperial) for a nice stroll or run.  Room adequate for a quick weekend stay.  Hotel is committed to &quot;Green&quot; initiatives.  Use of black-out drapes are strongly recommended as ambient neighborhood lights can be bright."
541504473,VCBCX1,United States,2017-11-16,Vancouver X Inn,The staff was outstanding and so is the hotel restaurant. The location if great with abundant shopping and dinning choices withing walking distance.    Do not miss out on the hotel restaurant.  It is above average and not overly priced. The breakfast is amazing.
292465790,VCBCX1,Utah,2015-07-25,Vancouver X Inn,Not sure where to start on this but don't get conned into staying here by your travel agent before a cruise like we did !!!! It is NO WHERE near the cruise ships. There are NO restaurants  unless you like the food court!! It was an HOUR bus ride from here to Stanley Park. It was a 1/2 hour train ride with 1/2 hour of walking to get to Stanley Park. Also the hotel is under construction. Looks terrible coming in!  The rooms are nice and the hotel is clean. That's why the 3 stars and not 0. Room wise the hotel is fine. But you literally have no business being here unless you like to visit malls or you have some Asian relatives. 
492379411,VCBCX1,Utrecht,2017-06-12,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel is modern and located near malls, shops, restaurants and the metro. The rooms are big and clean. Showering is done in the bath tub, but to drain the water, the drain valve should be elevated manually continuously, otherwise the drain closes itself directly. The cleaning service is very good. There are a few downsides however. Breakfast isn't having a lot of choice (almost no veggies, for example). The gym inside the hotel is very, very small, with only 3 cardio machines and dumbbells. You may use the gym across the street in the community center building. Staff is very attentive and friendly. For a XT hotel, I would have expected more facilities. "
163695992,VCBCX1,Va,2013-06-11,Vancouver X Inn,"We are XT Honors Diamond so we stay in a lot of XT family hotels.  I have to say that we have found more Hampton Inns better than XT (original).  We were so presently surprised at this hotel.  It is really lovely, clean, has concierge floor, staff is beyond wonderful, up to date, and I could go on and on at what a pleasant stay we had.  It is a little out of the way but extremely accessible to downtown Vancouver.  I understand if you take a cruise you can take the sky train right there. The price is right, too."
638874453,VCBCX1,"Valencia, California",2018-12-11,Vancouver X Inn,Very close to the rail so made it easy....also across from a large shopping mall and restaurants.  Would of liked to stayed closer to downtown but it was all sold out. XT did not disappoint room was clean! 
252010476,VCBCX1,"Vallejo, California",2015-01-31,Vancouver X Inn,"We were driving to Vancouver from Bellingham and booked a room here. We were happy about its location and free parking. We were visiting friends and just need affordable, clean, and can fit 4 ppl. We left early daily and arrived late at night. Our room was cleaned daily, despite the mess we made each night (towels on floor everywhere, lots of trash). The vacation was fun but quick. This hotel accomodated our needs, even opening garage door every midnight."
167948229,VCBCX1,Vancouver,2013-07-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Booked this last minute via Priceline. Upon mentioning to the hotel that it was our Anniversary the staff upgraded us to a suite. We were greeted with chocolate covered strawberries and cookies and milk! The staff at the hotel were happy and helpful. Being a local I can attest to the fact that the location of this hotel is quite central although its NOT in Vancouver (15 min skytrian or taxi ride to downtown). Its located beside the skytrain station, numerous bus stops and by Metrotown, the biggest Mall in the province. My only disappointment is that it costs to Park and use WiFi, although the ethernet connection is free and using my macbook I was able to create a wifi network."
203074769,VCBCX1,Vancouver,2014-04-27,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed two nights at the XT; the first night we were three girls as it was the night before my wedding.  The second night my husband and I stayed there. The staff were incredibly accommodating and did everything they could for us to ensure our stay was easy, including allowing for a late check out so that the girls and I could get ready as easily as possible.  We were a little complicated as the girls and I had a suite and then we needed to change to a wheel-chair accessible room for when my husband and I came back after the wedding.  I was completely impressed with how gracious and accommodating everyone at the XT was."
503704973,VCBCX1,"Vancouver Island, Canada",2017-07-19,Vancouver X Inn,"Totally DisappointedThe room was way too pricey for the quality. We checked in at 1130pm at night a walk in they had 2 rooms vacant I got 1 room with 2 queens and the other fellow got the same .There was broken tiles across the floor  in the bath room. The curtains were much worn and dirty with stains, the bathroom entrance door had stains on the wall .This room with taxes cost $463.67 a night - not worth it. They even charged me parking for my car and the desk officer said no charge for parking as parkade is closed for being a XT - I am surprised with the High price for the rooms should be ashamed for this. Take advantage of guest that has been driving for 10 hours. The beds where hard and the pillows where like unfilled cheap store pillows no support XT.com$299Travelocity.ca$299Expedia.ca$299Hotels.com$299Booking.com$299Ctrip.com$299HotelQuickly$352getaroom.com$296"
311785832,VCBCX1,"Vancouver Island, Canada",2015-09-19,Vancouver X Inn,"A two-day business trip to Vancouver resulted in an amazing dining experience. The XT Metrotown is located above a shopping mall dominated by Asian products, foods and dining. Had several amazing Chinese meals.....truly felt like I was in Guanzhou. Hotel is also situated next to the huge Metrotown mall and the Skytrain station to downtown Vancouver (15-20min away and cost about Cdn$4). "
263148097,VCBCX1,"Vancouver Island, Canada",2015-04-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Close to sky train and metro town , we went to a Canucks game and it was very easy to get to.

195929549,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, BC",2014-03-02,Vancouver X Inn,I attended a conference here.  There was extremely loud noise coming from the work on the next door Station Square mall.   The drill which sounded like a jack hammer was immediately on the other side of our wall!!   They moved us to another room which took about 45 minutes.  I think they should have warned the conference planners in advance.
463634582,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, BC, Canada",2017-02-28,Vancouver X Inn,"View from 10th floor north facing King suite was great, but the room on the opposite side of the hall had a bleak view of construction and parking lot. The pool deck was a bit of a challenge to locate, thru fitness centre, up staircase but our group of teen girls loved they had the pool deck all to themselves! A special treat to be in the warm water on a frosty morning."
360733769,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2016-04-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Want to stay in a hotel that has played host to Prime Ministers, heads of states and during the 2010 Winter Olympics, the Russian hockey team, then book it Danno at this impressive hotel in the heart of British Columbia's third largest city. With 283 rooms of which 69 are suites and seven wheelchair accessible, it sits just two blocks from Western Canada's second largest mall and similar steps to a sky train system that can whisk you away to downtown Vancouver in 20 minutes, and for much cheaper then a taxi. And after a hard day shopping or touring relax in the Reflect lounge where happy hour (3-6 p,m.) has $5 drinks and special appies, The lounge also features four large tv's and is open 11-midnight Sunday to Thursday and 11-1 Friday and Saturday. Put all this together with the Reflect restaurant open daily at 6 a.m., an outdoor swimming ;pool, and an incredible friendly staff and you have the basis for a wonderful stay. Does it sound like I did. You better believe it."
152754530,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2013-02-21,Vancouver X Inn,"I really enjoyed my stay at the XT. I stayed for half a day and was delighted to know the hotel offers a day rate. While the day rate is not cheap per se, it is more affordable than the full-day price. And hey, you definitely get what you pay for.For one, the premises are securer than other inns I've visited. The elevator only works when a patron inserts their room key in a slot; every floor after the second is accessible only by elevator. I kinda felt like James Bond, which is an extra perk, I suppose.The room I was given had a giant window with an excellent view of the snow-blanketed mountains in the distance and the bustling Metrotown shopping complex down below. The quarters were sparkly clean and organized both practically and aesthetically. A desk, recliner and footstool were positioned just by the window. On the desk, a complimentary and wired Internet connection worked perfectly. I will definitely stay again. Recommend it too!"
272884497,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2015-05-18,Vancouver X Inn,"If you want to stay in Burnaby, this is a good choice.  Crystal Mall and Metrotown are nearby for shopping and entertainment.  The Skytrain is only a few blocks away if you want to head to Vancouver, or you can walk to the Firefighters Club for a drink and dancing.  Great service at the hotel, everything was clean and in good shape; the decor is dated, but not a big deal.  There is an outdoor deck with lap pool, and hot tub.  Great to lounge in the chairs in the direct sunlight as a break from the lobby or sit at the tables in the covered area.  The Reflect Lounge has great happy hour specials.  The king size bed was comfortable.  The room has a safe, luggage rack, A/C and heat.  We had free wifi in the room, but it wasn't available in the lobby or lounge, but maybe they have a different code?"
412391387,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2016-08-29,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed here for one night. It's easy to find and conveniently located right next to the Metropolis mall. Parking is 12 dollars which is similar to other lots in the area. There is the option for valet for 16 dollars I believe. Check in was fast and efficient and the front desk agent was pleasant.My room was on the eleventh floor and looked out at construction which was a bummer but not anything that the hotel can fix. The room was nice, clean, and had a super comfy bed. I also liked the quality of the soaps and shampoos provided. We had vouchers for complimentary breakfast and that included fresh fruits, yogurts, danishes, juices, etc. The restaurant area is very nice. I didn't go in the pool or hot tub but I checked it out and it seemed fairly small. I would return. "
186212705,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2013-11-28,Vancouver X Inn,"I found this hotel to be perfectly situated for shopping in Burnaby (Greater Vancouver).  It is almost next to the huge shopping centre/mall.  It is surrounded by the business district and about 30 - 40 minutes from downtown Vancouver.I was there for a brief overnight stay and found it a bit tricky to drive into, but the accommodation was quite nice.  The room was small for the price and the bathroom was quite small too.  It was very clean and comfortable.  I didn't find it exceptional in any way, but could recommend it for its conference level.  The meals were good, the service and staff to be complimented.If you want to be in the Vancouver downtown area, this is not the hotel for you, but for the shopping district of Burnaby - perfect."
221032190,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2014-08-11,Vancouver X Inn,My bf and I stay at this hotel twice a year. We always get the breakfast deal. Unfortunately every time I have stayed the pool was under construction. Location: 5 mins walk to MetroTown (mall/ skytrain) Next to an Asian mall and Library ( The library has a beautiful park) usually the stay is quite. Accommodation: I have never slept on a better bed nor the pillows. I always check their website to purchase them.Breakfast: all you can eat. Great quality food and service! Wifi: I do not remember the wifi issue since we are out all the time shopping or watching a movie. I have always enjoyed my stay here.. Deff worth the money :) and yup they never rush you to check out.
392120502,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2016-07-13,Vancouver X Inn,"I took a chance and booked this Metrotown hotel over a few other more posh choices in downtown for my wedding night.  I am HHonors Diamond and stay at the XT chain about 80 to 120 nights a year on average.  For this particular stay I redeemed 40k points and booked online.  I also called the Frontdesk a couple days before my stay to see if any upgrades were available.  I know all hotels are pretty busy on a July Sat night in Vancouver due to the cruise and travel season, but Stephanie was so kind and told me to leave it with her.  Sure enough her promise came thru and we got an extremely wonderful suite on the 16th floor.  "
205381408,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2014-05-13,Vancouver X Inn,"XT Metro town was a nice surprise as I stayed for a week on a business trip.  The staff is friendly and the front desk is very efficient getting you to your room within minutes of arriving.   The valet was also resourceful.  I am a diamond club member with access to the executive lounge on he 18th floor. The lounge was well stocked with good selection of food and drinks with great views of the mountains.  My room was very clean with lots of space.  The only grip is the Dinner room service menu is limited in selection. It needs to be larger with more vegetarian dishes. .   Overall, the experience is very good."
185441905,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2013-11-21,Vancouver X Inn,Our OKM school soccer team stayed here during their Provincial Championships and we could not have been happier.  The ladies behind the desk were friendly and very helpful.  They had all the boys rooms ready for them when we arrived so it was very quick to get everyone into the right rooms. They also let us get the boys soccer kits in the laundry everyday which was fantastic when you are playing in rain!  The Bellman was the best!!  He made sure he knew how the boys were doing and wished them luck everyday. We will definitely stay here again.
498508822,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2017-07-04,Vancouver X Inn,"I  was here for work on May 30th 2017. The room was a decent size and clean.  The bed was comfy but all the pillows were too large for my liking. I checked out the pool and hot tub; both suck.  The hot tub was cold, actually colder than the pool, and is in need go some repairs.  The pool is long narrow for laps,  but it is curved with the building... wtf.When I made coffee I found some white sludge in my coffee and in the back of the coffee maker.With all the other hotels in this area why settle for this?

155293250,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2013-03-21,Vancouver X Inn,"This Hotel is ideally located on the Skytrain Line to downtown Vancouver and next to (less than 5 minute walk) Metrotown Mall. Once we were parked we didn't require our car for the entire weekend. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff, excellent dinner in the XT's &quot;Reflects&quot; restaurant, strolled over to the Mall for a little shopping and then took in a movie before strolling back to the Hotel. We enjoyed an excellent Sunday Brunch before a smooth and speedy check out = we'll be back!"
331314771,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2015-12-07,Vancouver X Inn,Stayed at this hotel for a work function in November.  Had a good room on one of the upper floors. We faced south east and watched a great sunset and sunrise Was a smaller room that had an odd configuration with the coffee pot behind the bathroom door.  Had hoped to use the pool and hot tub but just couldn't bring myself to go outside as it isn't an indoor pool.  Ate breakfast in the restaurant on the 3rd floor which was nice and convenient  All  and all it was a pleasant stay.
441435062,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2016-12-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Despite a fairly uneventful stay the checkout experience was sub par.With an early flight, we departed at 5:30am. The night manager was standoffish and did not seem interested on saying good bye. I have stayed here 4 times in the last 2 months and have another 4 ataya booked in the New Year.  This checkout was the worst service I have received,  There was no interest in my stay experience and no email receipt. There wasn't even a good bye smile. I was disappointed."

She needed new fall/winter clothing so I was planning to take her to Metrotown to do some shopping. To make it extra special I checked us into the XT. Janice one of the front desk hosts, helped me from the beginning and made every effort to make my daughters stay extra special. All the staff were so wonderful and I would highly recommend the XT at this location."
464936378,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2017-03-04,Vancouver X Inn,"Guest room was quiet, comfortable and clean.  Guest room wifi and conference room wifi was excellent.  Conference room was frigidly cold, people had to wear their winter coats during our meetings. Catering was poor, no labels on the food items at receptions and buffets, little to few options for vegetarians or people with food sensitivities.  Guest room price was very fair and reasonable. Staff were friendly catering fell short."
344895076,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2016-02-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Always a very enjoyable stay, and convenient to Metrotown, and the Firefighters Pub, a frequented pub because of their bands.  Had the most divine Benny for breakfast.. It is always fun to use the pool, and the staff are extremely pleasant and accommodating.

478383050,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2017-04-23,Vancouver X Inn,"We booked the hotel because it was partnered with the Burnaby Riverway Golf Club Wedding event. They treated it us so well and your room is also discounted for staying there and having your wedding at the Riverway Golf Club. They went beyond and above the call of duty. I would recommend the XT Metrotown for their food, service and stay. They even put a couple package today. Thank you XT Metrotown."
215474854,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Canada",2014-07-14,Vancouver X Inn,Check In staff substituted a lower value room than what was reserved.  It wasn't a question of the availablility as she managed to find the room when I complained and it wasn't a matter of missing the information as she reviewed other details on the notes for the reservation.  She simply wanted to put me in a cheaper room to allow her to rent out the better room later for a higher rate.
190356691,VCBCX1,"vancouver, Canada",2014-01-09,Vancouver X Inn,"hotel gave good room pricing for team, and parents, 14 yr old boys were all on one floor, breakfast pricing also gave break. I didn't upgrade to the executive floors as didn't want temptation to eat extra calories and wanted room closer to boys.  Hotel is essentially in Chinatown like area, so food was good. Parking was free which was nice, I think included with room price."

The property is located right in the middle of metrotown, a big shopping/entertainment area.

178454974,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, WA",2013-09-24,Vancouver X Inn,"This XT is located in Burnaby which is adjacent to the city of Vancouver.  The Skytrain is just a few blocks away, which provides an easy and economical way to tour Vancouver.   "
237850719,VCBCX1,"Vancouver, Washington, United States",2014-11-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here in Sept. 2014, and very pleased. Were in town celebrating our anniversary and wanted to be close to downtown Vancouver B.C. This XT is just a short drive or train wide to downtown. Very nice rooms, good service, and great location to sky train--- just a short walk down the street. Ask for a room on a high floor - great view of the city!"
167695160,VCBCX1,"Varadero, Cuba",2013-07-15,Vancouver X Inn,"Had a great stay at Metrotown XT. Room was clean, cool and quiet. Bed was ok, pillows were awesome!!Pool area is small and sunny, hard to find but a nice treat. Restraunt is good, a bit pricey... Try and get the buffet breakie comp'd with your room! A bit expensive otherwise. We had the valet service comp'd. My Escape was NOT dinged when I left it, and I have since found several 'rubs and bumps' not cool!!"
550309847,VCBCX1,venice,2017-12-30,Vancouver X Inn,"I picked this room since it was located near the transit station and was was great. Close by was Tim Horton's, Starbucks and other shops. Room was clean and up to XT brand. The hallways were very warm and stagnant.  The pool was difficult to get to and stairs that you needed to get to the pool were very slippery and no signage to return to elevators. Minor issues that could be resovled easily."
525319757,VCBCX1,"venice, United States",2017-09-17,Vancouver X Inn,Room wa s great. Good location with staff help to get around with recommendations. We were treated as a person not a number.Staff was attentive to every need and helpful. Hotel offered everything we wanted. If in Vancouver this is where I would stay. All staff appeared happy and would go out of their way to be kind
391211129,VCBCX1,"Vernon, Canada",2016-07-10,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at this location over the weekend of July 10th. It is absolutely beautiful! There's valet parking for $14 if you want or you can park your own car underground.Our room was huge and the bed and pillows were superb. Now we didn't have breakfast included in our rate but we decided it looked worth paying the 39$ per person for reflections buffet. And it really was the food was out of this world they had things like crab legs, smoked salmon, mussels, among the regular breakfast items as well. If you are hesitant to put out the money don't be! Can't wait to return one day!"
273462307,VCBCX1,"Vernon, Canada",2015-05-20,Vancouver X Inn,"hotel resturant and pub service was terrible. Waiters and Bartenders had very poor attitudes and wouldn't even try to make the experience better. Pool was dirty. I've stayed in many XT Hotels and got Top service, this one not so much.  Do I really want to spend another $150.00 to find out...no.Very disappointed."
439664915,VCBCX1,"Vernon, Canada",2016-11-23,Vancouver X Inn,"I/we have stayed at this property over the past three years.  Somehow the management and staff always expand and improve upon the WOW factor they deliver.  It is comforting to know that the XT Metrotown values and thanks me/us as returning, valued clients.  A very warm, friendly and well managed property."
361931134,VCBCX1,"Vernon, Canada",2016-04-05,Vancouver X Inn,Stayed here for a tournament and the staff was amazing. They arranged a meeting room for the coaches and allowed us to have team pizza dinners in there as well. The rooms had very large mini fridges and were very nice. The pool is hard to get to but the kids loved it and our team will be back next year. 
471557082,VCBCX1,"Vernon, Canada",2017-03-30,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is first class. Anytime I am in the Vancouver area I stay here. The amenities and service are excellent. The location is perfect. You can take the skytrain downtown in 15 mins.  The rooms, bed, tv and internet are all top shelf. For what you get it is an excellent value."
454651419,VCBCX1,"Vernon, Canada",2017-01-23,Vancouver X Inn,"Professional staff and clean guest rooms and common areas are the highlight of this XT.  The staff were very helpful with local attractions, restaurants, etc.  The location near the Metrotown Mall was perfect for shopping, as well."
161296342,VCBCX1,"vernon, Canada",2013-05-18,Vancouver X Inn,Attended location because of an appointment in the area.  Upon making reservation I was treated with care to ensure our stay was as comfortable as possible.  Great staff!  They made our stay feel like a mini vacation.
240923339,VCBCX1,"Vernon, Canada",2014-11-21,Vancouver X Inn,"Continued and consistent first class service in a first class hotel.  An oasis in an unexpected area of Greater Vancouver, close to light rapid transit and shopping. Highly recommend to business and solo travellers."

216165681,VCBCX1,"Vernon, Canada",2014-07-18,Vancouver X Inn,Exceptionally helpful and accommodating staff.  This XT has one of the best Executive Lounges in the XT system. Great location.  One of the best managed and operated hotels in Greater Vancouver.
469980659,VCBCX1,"Vernon, Canada",2017-03-24,Vancouver X Inn,"This Property continues to deliver an excellent experience as evidenced by their friendly and service oriented front end, restaurant, bar and lounge staff.  A very well managed and maintained property."
246775983,VCBCX1,Victoria,2014-12-31,Vancouver X Inn,"Good location for shopping at Metrotown, but found that the room was designed for a tall person.  The towel rack was positioned high above the tub and I couldn't reach the towels on the top rack.  The make-up mirror was also high and far away.  Bathroom door was heavy and kept banging shut.  It would  not stay open unless it was propped up (I used my boots).  Noisy fan/air conditioner and uncomfortable bed so we didn't get much sleep the first night.  Second night was quieter as I just turned off the fan entirely.  Got a good rate so the value was okay, but I probably wouldn't stay here again."
468400668,VCBCX1,Victoria,2017-03-18,Vancouver X Inn,I have stayed at the Hikton Metrotown many times for business. The staff are very friendly and professional. The rooms are always clean and a decent size. I have never had any complaints here. There is presently a loypt of construction in the area however this was not a problem in terms of noise. The hotel restaurant has great food that is reasonably priced and the hotel is near several good restaurants. Metrotown mall is a 5 minute walk and the sky train is also 5 minutes away. I will stay here again for sure.
209978573,VCBCX1,Victoria,2014-06-11,Vancouver X Inn,Hotel is in good location and staff are efficient. Room is quiet and nice and comfortable. Good size too and have all items provided as you would expect in a good hotel. But parking is a problem when you try to find a spot during busy time of the day (which is almost all business hours). Special thanks to our server in the restaurant who is very helpful and efficient.
579051466,VCBCX1,Victoria,2018-05-09,Vancouver X Inn,I would highly recommend this Hotel - it is clean and the staff are friendly. Rooms are nice and the pool area is great! Also their restaurant is good and service there is awesome You will be happy here!  
452055266,VCBCX1,"Victoria Capital Regional District, Canada",2017-01-15,Vancouver X Inn,i have always heard that the XT was a high end hotel and was so excited to stay there. i was sadly disappointed as it seemed to be a pretty generic hotel that fid nor have the class i expected. The coffee sucked.
163238140,VCBCX1,"Victoria, British Columbia",2013-06-06,Vancouver X Inn,"Two babies and a 10 year old with us. Excellent staff and service who attended to our family's needs. Well cared for hotel. Minor issue with room cleanliness, but did not detract from our experience. food was very good and prices were very good for a hotel of this status. Great checkin service. Room service very friendly."
597988059,VCBCX1,"Victoria, British Columbia, Canada",2018-07-20,Vancouver X Inn,"skytrain is 2 short blocks away -- go downtown Vancouver (20 min) and explore - go to the end of the line and catch the seabus to the north shore -- shops at the quay or take the westcoast express to communities in the valley or  change trains at the bay and head out to the airport.the staff at the XT are always exceptional -- all staff without exception in my experience, welcoming and helpful providing wonderful service.if you are working downtown Vancouver - consider here -- - great shopping at the mall , quite a few  interesting restaurants  and just a convenient , central hotel. the staff really though make the hotel and I travel a fair amount for business - when I m here , I am happy - they are really well trained"
194976206,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2014-02-22,Vancouver X Inn,"We are a family of 4 staying across town on a hockey tournament at a different hotel which we did not like and were contemplating staying at the XT, but our 9 yr old was undecided. We were about to leave when Joseph representing the concierge explained to our 9 yr old son of the virtues of listening to his parents and showed us pictures of his own children he was coaching in their journey as elite golfers.   This was enough to impress both our boys and so we stayed. Sure glad we did, spotless, modern hotel, excellent location for shopping, no need to drive, escalator in lobby to shopping, Metrotown across street, outdoor POOL (although closed when we stayed as was freezing outside), gym (and yes, kids 9 and 12 could go there without adults - we asked) and skytrain station, etc. and for us, with car, easy in and out parking downstairs and only 10 minute drive to Burnaby 8 Rinks arena. We will be back!!"
215654222,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2014-07-15,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel was recommended as part of the workshop I attended. There was no microwave I guess I should not have assumed that they would have had one, and because it was a 5 day stay it would have been very helpful. They were going to charge me $8/day for internet internet, again I assumed it would be free. Lastly, I was charged for parking ($11/day), I don't travel a huge amount, yet I don't ever recall having to pay for parking before. If I would have investigated more before I booked I would not have stayed there. Never assume that the conveniences that you get at places like the Super *8, come every where. I did spend the next 2 nights at the Super * in Vernon and Salmon Arm not only was there free internet, parking, there was a continental breakfast for a much better price. Both places were very clean and very warm and welcoming."
241154723,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2014-11-23,Vancouver X Inn,"Had some problems with XT's customer call centre. Brought it to the attention of Chris (manager at this location). He took care of my needs, gave me a free upgrade and checked in throughout. Hotel is quiet, well located to Metrotown, and was very clean. Most of the staff were great and helpful. It's amazing how an individual can make you go from dissatisfied (with XT's call centre) to extremely satisfied (with this location). Chris did that and then some. I've recommended the location to my colleagues and am planning another trip back in early 2015. The other big plus for me was the elevators. Super quick and that is a huge pet peeve when I stay in big hotels. Thanks again Chris!"
628896024,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2018-10-27,Vancouver X Inn,"Me and my girlfriend were on our anniversary, staying at the hotel. Not to undermine the great check in experience we received, but the Reflex social restaurant was nothing short of greatness, Cecilia and Marketa both made us feel like long time friends, and it is a great reflexion of what XT promises to deliver when choosing their brand. Both Cecilia and Marketa were genuinely trying to get to know us on a personal level, and it wasnâ€™t at all forced or fake. We stayed at this hotel before, but this particular stay was exceptional. All around a great experience and will be coming back!"
199857431,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2014-03-31,Vancouver X Inn,"As a wheelchair user not checking into a designated accessible room (we wanted a one-bedroom suite as we were traveling with our young son) I was nervous that the washroom wouldn't work for me based on photos showing configuration. I needn't have worried as the door swung out instead of in, leaving no issues whatsoever. The staff was fantastic, very helpful. As well, we were delighted with the welcome package for our 3 year old consisting of a colouring book and crayons as well as a gift certificate for milk and cookies. A very nice touch that will likely bring us back."
490684069,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2017-06-05,Vancouver X Inn,"I came here with friends on a team trip. The suites were very spacious, some with nice views of mountains. The fridge was not properly functioning though - it was barely cold and there was no way to adjust it. The buffet breakfast and the nice pool area with a water fountain really topped it all off though. The buffet breakfast offered pancakes, waffles, my favorite flavors of yogurt, and a lot more. The pool area had three pools; a thin lane pool, a hot tub and a warmish tub for children. There was also a small gym, but the pool area overshadowed it by far."
313817709,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2015-09-26,Vancouver X Inn,"I had a very pleasant stay overnight at this hotel. The room was clean and well-appointed, the staff were courteous and prompt and the amenities were decent. The only complaint I have is minor - the hotel's restaurant and convention floors are a bit of a maze, spread over three floors and spanning over a shopping arcade. The restaurant was excellent - I had a very pleasant breakfast there. The shopping arcade food court (accessible through the hotel) had a very large selection of traditional Chinese food vendors for an alternative dining experience."
282535623,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2015-06-23,Vancouver X Inn,"I attended a conference at the Burnaby XT Hotel. Surrounded by malls and high rises, I wondered what my experience would be like. It was excellent. They couldn't do enough for you including showing amazing concern over my request for flatter pillows.  Yes, they had some. Their conference buffet food was a notch about the usual and I had excellent service in their restaurant for lunch. The rooftop pool (lap pool) and hot tub were clean. While I was there a staffer tested the water which is always reassuring. Nice place to stay."
547422667,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2017-12-15,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed here for one night in December and enjoyed a staff Xmas part in the Baccarat room.  Hotel room was clean and modern. A significant construction project across the street could be heard during the day but work stopped at ~3:30 pm and it really didnâ€™t prove to be bothersome. Room was quite and any movement in the hallways didnâ€™t bother our sleep.  Had room service for breakfast, despite a couple of mix ups the staff corrected everything in a pleasant manner. I would stay here again.  "
327540361,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2015-11-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed in Burnaby to visit family and found the XT perfectly located for everything we needed, including convenient access to the skytrain to go downtown to a show.  The shopping mall has everything and the Crystal mall right beside the hotel with its market and restaurants is a fabulous taste of China.  The hotel room was clean and comfortable and the one dinner we had in the hotel restaurant was excellent.  The bed was very comfortable."
330266516,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2015-12-01,Vancouver X Inn,"We stay at the XT every year when my husband has his Christmas party at the fire hall close by. We took the  XT shuttle to the party, and on the way back we decided to walk and get some fresh air. The driver saw us walking back and we waved and he picked us up. We were thankful because we weren't as close as we thought. Great service and a great stay as usual with the XT."
313698451,VCBCX1,"vICTORIA, Canada",2015-09-25,Vancouver X Inn,I recently stayed at the XT Metro town for a conference. I was very impressed with how friendly and welcoming the staff were and how much they cared about their guests. My room was clean and updated and if I needed something extra they were quick to oblige. The staff in the lounge were also friendly and funny. I would stay there again but next time for the shopping next door !
162929367,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2013-06-03,Vancouver X Inn,"I travel to this hotel often for work, both to stay and host conferences. The staff are always amazing and very accommodating. It's is truly always a pleasure and I look forward to my next stay.  The staff in the lounge provide a positive experience and are very knowledgeable and quick to remedy any mix-ups or provide suggestions if the wine you want is not in stock"
154963010,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2013-03-18,Vancouver X Inn,Nice and clean hotel. Staff are friendly. The bed is comfortable. Bathroom is clean and towels are nice and soft. The sound proof between hall way and the rooms are acceptable. Checking out is efficient and painless. No real compliant except the parkade and it is the worst in 4 stars hotels in Greater Vancouver area. It is not their fault as it came with the mall.
593121955,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2018-07-04,Vancouver X Inn,"I am a frequent business traveller -I adore the staff at this hotel - they are all more than helpful, welcoming and can solve any problem.  Attached to the hotel is a great Asian Food court. There are a number of good to excellent  restaurants close by, across the street one way is a Goodlife Gym and the other way is a great mall including a movie theatre."
208634558,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2014-06-02,Vancouver X Inn,"The staff here are top notch!  Warm, friendly, and go out of their way to make your stay the best it can be!  The rooms are clean, nicely decorated, and welcoming as well, and the location is fantastic!  Metrotown is across the street, and downtown Vancouver is a short drive or sky train trip away!  Great hotel, awesome staff, and great location!"
357196102,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2016-03-20,Vancouver X Inn,"This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel. Regrettably, the bathroom sink and bathtub sink were both clogged. I was having a shower and the water level rose to my ankles - had to try and clear the clog myself as I wanted to finish showering. Beds were nice and clean though, which is a plus. Would've given 5 stars if not for the bathroom issues."
165276530,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2013-06-25,Vancouver X Inn,"A lovely hotel with spacious rooms and great beds!  Very friendly front desk personnel.   Parking is a challenge...multiple levels and multi-use.  I found it quite confusing and didn't feel there were sufficient directional signs once underground. Other than that, a very pleasant stay at this lovely hotel in a prime location."
222806434,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2014-08-18,Vancouver X Inn,The XT Metro Town is our Home away from Home when in Vancouver. ALL employees are outstanding and professional.

The breakfast buffet is outstanding and very reasonably priced.
631855770,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2018-11-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Clean, quiet and quick service. Plus no bugs. Hotel is part of the crystal mall complex so lots of choices for food. Also close to Metro Town. I used the Travelocity app and no hassle at all at check in. The only down side that the room was beside the service elevator but I was not not noticeable which is good."
210875831,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2014-06-17,Vancouver X Inn,"I love the XT in Metrotown, I only went there bcz I had a groupon that was a good price, free parking and credit for the dining room. Other than that I probably couldn't afford to stay there. Once I was there, I'm not sure I can stay anywhere else now, it was very nice and the service was very good."
369739133,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2016-05-02,Vancouver X Inn,"Had an issue checking in, as this was a prepay business stay, I had reserved on my credit card, they should have clarified me prior to checkin, that the paperwork I was sending with my employee was all correct. So my employee's had a difficult time checking in, and had to come up with $200 cash deposit."
183605750,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2013-11-04,Vancouver X Inn,"This is a good hotel to stay when doing business in Burnaby or the surrounding area. Convenient, clean and a good location.

491524364,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2017-06-08,Vancouver X Inn,"A nice comfortable room but there was no Wifi for the duration of our stay, I was mostly told I must be doing something wrong, funny thing is we stayed at the XT in Kamloops the next two nights and the Wifi was great! The parking lot is a disaster, 25 min. To get parked."
188750068,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2013-12-27,Vancouver X Inn,We stayed in Burnaby to visit with family. Once again we stayed at the XT near Metrotown.

No line ups during the check ins or check outs. The price was way too much for the services I received. I feel the price should be less.
259204313,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2015-03-12,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed in the executive suite in this hotel, while it was clean and decent, it was very mediocre for the price I paid.

336214770,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2015-12-30,Vancouver X Inn,"Used XT Honors points for a quick Christmas time visit. Room was in disrepair, the elevator was filthy, and my check-in was mishandled. I am now moving on from XT as the brand seems to be sinking."
161291855,VCBCX1,"Victoria, Canada",2013-05-15,Vancouver X Inn,"Too expensive for what you get, Must pay $8.00 for Wi-Fi. Breakfast is way too slow. I would not recommend this for anyone. The staff were very good. It was close to the sky train and Metro town Mall."
253091375,VCBCX1,"Vila do Conde, Portugal",2015-02-07,Vancouver X Inn,Quality staffThe wifi was a little sketchyRoom very comfortableWas there overnight and for a banquetThe banquet went wellStaff very friendlyThe location works well if Burnaby is you locationNear sky train also good
440097860,VCBCX1,"Vilnius, Lithuania",2016-11-26,Vancouver X Inn,"We were there for 6 days and honestly this kind of 4 stars hotel not suits for 4 stars... maybe for for 3 or even 2. Car parking was too expensive like for a hotel visitors it should be minimum charge, but it was only 2 $ cheaper like to a simple visitor... Breakfast was really fine and service was also amazing."
183118923,VCBCX1,"Walla Walla, United States",2013-10-31,Vancouver X Inn,"The hotel was excellent.  Very nice. The location was within walking distance to many activites such as mall, resturants, and local businesses.  The only issue was, I did not like being charged $8.00 per device for the use of the internet in room."
419535410,VCBCX1,"Warrenpoint, United Kingdom",2016-09-17,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed for one night as a stopover before flying out of Vancouver International which was a 20 minute car journey (off-peak). There is not much to do around the hotel but the train station is a short walk away to bring you to the main attractions. Room was nice , not much of a view. Breakfast was good with either buffet or set menu available. Drinks at the bar are well-priced and the terrace is nice if it is not raining. Didn't have the opportunity to try the outdoor pools sadly. Checking in and out was seamless."
615493082,VCBCX1,"Warrington, UK",2018-09-10,Vancouver X Inn,"Great location if you fancy visiting the massive shopping centre.  But apart from that, not such a special area.  We were given Executive lounge access, and whilst the food at 'canape time' was excellent, I would have loved a glass of wine but the only bottle there was a Spanish red.  You would have thought that since it was an honesty bar, so people were paying for it, they could have offered more choice.  So we went down tot he hotel bar where I found an excellent Merlot.   Breakfast was patchy and I'm afraid my omelette was quite tasteless.   We were disturbed at night by the extremely noisy ice machine."
177932508,VCBCX1,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",2013-09-20,Vancouver X Inn,"I stayed at the XT Metrotown for 5 nights and could not have been happier. First, the room was spacious, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the toiletries were high quality. Second, the amenities included were fantastic. The breakfast offered eggs, potatoes, cereal, bread, fruit, pastries, cereal, and yogurt. We only made it to happy hour once, but there were snack mixes, veggies, cheese, crackers and desserts. Wifi was free, which I have rarely found in a western hotel. Finally, the staff was extremely courteous and friendly. The hotel was a short walk to the Sky Train, which made for easy sight seeing. A great place to stay! "
603406024,VCBCX1,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",2018-08-06,Vancouver X Inn,"From the moment I pulled up in the driveway I was warmly greeted by a friendly Valet who happened to be from the Philippines. The Hotel room was spotless, food was excellent and its connected to a Chinese mall. I felt like I was in Singapore.I can't wait to go back with my family!"
227955191,VCBCX1,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",2014-09-09,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed for one week, had a great experience.  Staff was friendly, polite, knowledgeably and most importantly quick.  The rooms are sound proof and spacious.  The area is also clean and close to the skytrain station.  Takes about 20-25 minutes to get to downtown Vancouver"
207551876,VCBCX1,"Waterloo, Ia",2014-05-28,Vancouver X Inn,We had a 3 day visit to Vancouver and this was the perfect hotel.  Metrotown mall is right across the street and there are many good restaurants within walking distance.  The rooms were suites and very nice.  The hotel staff was very kind and helped us get excellent internet access.  We took a couple of day trips with a tour company and they picked us up at our hotel.  Very convenient!
219820438,VCBCX1,"West Chester, Pennsylvania",2014-08-05,Vancouver X Inn,"I am a XT guy so I have Diamond Status and get the free breakfast and Honors Lounge use so that perhaps makes my opinion different from someone that does not have those benefits. I stay at all XT brands from Waldorf down through Hampton Inn for a total of maybe 75 nights a year. I would never use the same scale to grade a XT as I would a Hampton Inn. I think I have a pretty clear understanding of what to expect at each brand hotel in the chain.This is a very good XT. It would be a great Doubletree, but it is not a Waldorf.Modern, clean, fast internet, good service and the 18th floor Honors lounge was a very good one. No complaints at all. Will stay here again. Price was about the same as the Hampton at the Airport I also stayed at. Your money is a hundred times better spent here.While the SkyTrain is only a block or two walk, the location is a little out of town."
315839806,VCBCX1,"West Malling, Kent",2015-10-03,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, on the Executive floor.  Although somewhat smaller than one may expect from North American hotel rooms, there was plenty of wardrobe and cupboard space, plus it afforded terrific views of the city and the mountains beyond.  The bed was comfortable, the room clean, the en suite clean and sufficient.  The hotel provided shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion and soap.We breakfasted in the Executive Lounge/Dining Room except for one morning where we ate in the main restaurant.  The service was excellent and friendly, and the food was good with plenty of choice in both.The location of the hotel was the best thing - it was within a short walking distance of trains and buses which proved to be very efficient, including links to the airport.All in all, a good base for experiencing downtown Vancouver, which is a lovely city."
183229569,VCBCX1,"West Vancouver, British Columbia",2013-11-01,Vancouver X Inn,"Outstanding 'dog friendly' hotel. Dog bed and feeding bowls were provided plus a treat bag of Milkbone biscuits. All staff went out of their way to assist. The meals provided were excellent, the rooms were well appointed. I look forward to attending again in 2015."
357206024,VCBCX1,"West Vancouver, Canada",2016-03-20,Vancouver X Inn,"A fantastic venue for meetings/trade show, excellent service, friendly staff.  Good restaurant, food very good.  We have had a trade show at the XT, twice a year for 12 years, service could not be better.  Metrotown is nearby, and lots of restaurants.  Recommend highly!"
404757238,VCBCX1,"westfield, nj",2016-08-12,Vancouver X Inn,"In terms of value, this hotel is alright in terms of price I suppose.  As others have mentioned, the hotel is in Metrotown, and is attached to the Crystal mall, which is a very very Chinese shopping center.  The second floor of the mall has direct access to the food court of the mall, which if you want to have a variety of Chinese/Asian food, is great.  We like it.  It was like being in Asia, but where everyone speaks English.  Greater Vancouver can be accessed via the metro which is a short walk from the hotel.  The overall area around the hotel also has a very Asian flavor as well, with Asian supermarkets also located in the general area.  As others have mentioned, the hotel is about 30 minutes in terms of a metro ride to downtown, and can be busy as this is a major commuter line (well, there are only a few lines, so all of them are busy at rush hours).  "
167744707,VCBCX1,"Westminster, United States",2013-07-15,Vancouver X Inn,"Excellent location for shopping asian or canadian goods. Good price and close to Vancouver downtown. All luxury features of XT at bargain price close to downtown Vancouver. We enjoy the  hot breakfast for an additional  $4.00 . Staff were very nice and helpfull,"
482657408,VCBCX1,"Whistler, Canada",2017-05-08,Vancouver X Inn,We last stayed at Christmas and again you have wow'd us!Great food in the restaurant both for dinner and breakfast! Great selection for a continental offering ! My wife upgraded and loved the hot side and the eggs to order. Your chef blew us away with his amazing creation of beef stroganoff.I last had beef stroganoff in Moscow but this unique offering of this classic is worth a try! Great room and the separate room offer nice with the two kids. Nice to use the pool/hot tub. Last visit too much snow to jump in.We will be back as the bonus is the shopping right next door at Metrotown!Thank you again Tim Koshul Whistler 
638182180,VCBCX1,"Whistler, Canada",2018-12-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Our annual family stay and shopping trip was amazing again! With Metrotown mall minutes away you canâ€™t ask for a more convenient location. Great suite with 2 rooms to with our 2 kids. Amazing lunch in the restaurant ( Jose took good care of us) Marketa ( hope spelling right Czech server @ breakfast) great service and recognized us from last Xmas , even remembered where we sat... ps good idea was the pizza feature in our room for dinner!

627944518,VCBCX1,"Whistler, Canada",2018-10-24,Vancouver X Inn,"Although it was only a short trip, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this property! All of the staff we encountered throughout our stay were very friendly and incredibly helpful- front desk staff, valet services and breakfast servers all had a smile on their face and were always willing to make sure they went above and beyond. Special mention to Leonora who checked us in- she was fantastic!"
613888298,VCBCX1,"Whistler, Canada",2018-09-04,Vancouver X Inn,"We stayed one night during my sons soccer tournament. The front desk staff were very welcoming and professional,  the room was clean and well appointed. Also was rewarded as a XT honer guest. Great hotel for everyone. "
562458519,VCBCX1,"Whitchurch-Stouffville, Canada",2018-02-24,Vancouver X Inn,I donâ€™t ask for much but every time I needed something they were very helpful (including making change for leaving a tip).I was across from the construction zone but up enough floors that I didnâ€™t hear anything (12th floor).The proximity to the grocery store was great as well.Iâ€™d happily stay there again.
545855686,VCBCX1,"White Rock, Canada",2017-12-07,Vancouver X Inn,"This review is primarily for XT Gold Members - the hotel itself is fine, bathrooms are dated, beds are comfortable, coffee maker is obsolete...but my issue is that I reserved here specifically as a loyalty member assuming that there would be access to lounge and possible upgrades as I am a gold member. Usually I get these little perks at XT and as a frequent traveller they are much appreciated. After arriving here, I was disappointed to find that there are no upgrades for golds, and only diamonds have access to the business lounge. Not just that I was unlucky tonight (its dead here)  - that is their everyday policy. Just wanted to send the head's up for other golds out there who may be considering this property. I'd stay at the Holiday Inn next time as it is better connected to the mall and room quality is similar."
596767916,VCBCX1,"White Rock, Canada",2018-07-16,Vancouver X Inn,"Hitting the Sixteenth Floor and above, the water to the west is amazing to see some of the English Bay and the ships out there!The Bed was comfy, and the room clean - the chairs in this hotel need the room re-upholstering  ; but the staff are all very congenial and accomodating"
240480906,VCBCX1,"Whitehorse, Canada",2014-11-18,Vancouver X Inn,I stayed at the Burnaby XT and it was excellent. The room are clean and have modern appointments. There is WiFi. The hotel is in a central location and has a good restaurant. I attended a function at the hotel and the food was good. The staff was friendly and helpful. You cannot go wrong staying at this hotel.
532238683,VCBCX1,"Whitehorse, Canada",2017-10-11,Vancouver X Inn,"I highly recommend this hotel from the rooms, services, staff and the extras provided.  They even had a movie night for the kids which they loved.  They are always very accommodating, it's an excellent location and the quality of food is great."
573370002,VCBCX1,"Whitehorse, Canada",2018-04-14,Vancouver X Inn,Love the hotel restaurant.  Great service in restaurant and front desk and valet are all wonderful and hospitable.  Very clean rooms and quiet at night.  Outdoor hot tub is a nightlight.  I highly recommend this hotel.

178501800,VCBCX1,"Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada",2013-09-24,Vancouver X Inn,I travel to Vancouver 1-2 times a year and always stay at this hotel. It's location to Metrotown is fabulous and they beds are always very comfortable. I have stayed at other hotels near by and to me it's well worth the extra $20 or $30 a night at this hotel!
387839925,VCBCX1,"Williams Lake, Canada",2016-06-30,Vancouver X Inn,"Don't expect too much and you'll be happy. Clean and a reasonable value compared to some of the alternatives. Central location makes it easy to get downtown by public transportation and good shopping is located right accross the street. Dining choices are somewhat limited but you can find a meal. I enjoy the outdoor hot tub, pool is a little small but at least kids can get wet."
292082023,VCBCX1,"Wilmington, Massachusetts",2015-07-24,Vancouver X Inn,"We spent 2 nights a this hotel. Lrge bedroom and living room. Too bad there was nothing to put or hang our clothes in the bedroom, not even a chair !!!Modern but very cold deco especially in the lobby. Very clean suite and comfortable bed.Located in a chinese district with a small chinese mall next door where we had a good diner. A huge mall was close by as was the train station.A little bit far from downtown (about 20mn by train). The breakfast was good in a very nice room with terrace."
302352695,VCBCX1,"Wilno, Ontario, Canada",2015-08-22,Vancouver X Inn,The hotel itself is like most others of it's price range ... the food was good quality (breakfast buffet) and delicious. The elevators on the other hand were slow to arrive. It seems to be a cross between high class gentility and the average hotel. It's likely I will not stay there again
364750582,VCBCX1,"wilsonville, United States",2016-04-16,Vancouver X Inn,"This XT is located close to the metro and within walking distance to a nearby part. Great location, clean hotel with very friendly staff for a fraction of the cost of similar hotels downtown Vancouver. A short metro ride will get you downtown. I have stayed in this hotel for business and with family and will come back"
192613150,VCBCX1,"Winnipeg, Canada",2014-01-30,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel is my usual place to stay when in Vancouver.  The staff is always incredible and make me feel like I am at home away from home.  It had been 9 months since my last stay and when checking in Sharina remembered me which always makes a person feel special.  The staff in the Reflect Dining room and Lounge are also great and remember me everytime!  It's a great feeling to walk into the restaurant and be greeted by Shasheel when coming in for breakfast.  I can't say enough good things about the staff in this hotel, and it is my favorite hotel to stay in on all my business travels!"
221011702,VCBCX1,"Winnipeg, Canada",2014-08-10,Vancouver X Inn,My stay in Vancouver was a wonderful holiday for myself and two granddaughters.  Staying at the XT in Burnaby was an excellent choice for us.  The hotel was located next to the Skytrain making it easy to get around the city/  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful to us each day with any questions we had for them.  The room was clean and pleasant.  We enjoyed the pool and hot tub each evening.  To the delight of my granddaughters there was also a huge mall within walking distance with hundreds of shops. When I return to Vancouver I definitely will chose the XT in Burnaby.
252537713,VCBCX1,"Winnipeg, Canada",2015-02-03,Vancouver X Inn,"Was disappointed internet cut in an out. Dirty glasses not picked up and cleaned. Noisy wall paper thin so could hear everything next door, could not recommend a good restaurant. Next to a major mall but not close to anything. Paid extra for the free breakfast. So it is not free. The reason why no one is in the restaurant is because it was not very good but expensive. Learned the hard way.   Have to go back for a conference so I will try again. But disappointed."
205669903,VCBCX1,"Winnipeg, Canada",2014-05-15,Vancouver X Inn,"This hotel has a great location in Burnaby with easy access to downtown on the Skytrain which is located a few blocks from the hotel.  The staff is amazing!  Sharina always greets me with a big smile and makes me feel welcomed and at home at the front desk, and Susheel treats me like a valued guest and family member in the restaurant!  I love this place and on my business travels it is the hotel I look forward to staying at the most!"
222089243,VCBCX1,"Winnipeg, Canada",2014-08-15,Vancouver X Inn,The staff at this hotel will have you waiting for your next trip to Vancouver to stay here again! From Sharina and Sergei at the front desk to Susheel and the staff in the restaurant! I am made to feel at home every time I stay here and I absolutely love this hotel. The beds are super comfy as well!The location is also very convenient to the sky train and only a 10 minute train ride from downtown. I highly recommend this hotel!
163416061,VCBCX1,"Winnipeg, Canada",2013-06-08,Vancouver X Inn,"Hotel would be good for business. Not entirely friendly for family. No play area for children. No fridge in room. Everything else is excellent. Room is clean, offers excellent view and is very quite. For the value that I got, it was excellent.  My only disappointment was not being family friendly."
396345252,VCBCX1,"Winnipeg, Canada",2016-07-24,Vancouver X Inn,"Stayed for weekend got upgraded to incredible suit that was luxuries and wonderful. Beautiful room, quiet, comfy bed and super clean.

356685016,VCBCX1,"winnipeg, manitoba     canada",2016-03-18,Vancouver X Inn,"fantastic views when on higher floors. clean and well run. valet parking is well worth it as the underground parking is a little hard to navigate and sometimes quite full. my only complaint is there is no in house coin op laundry as a business traveler that is quite important,  and no bank machine on site, which makes it hard to tip your valet but I made it work. restaurant on the 3rd floor is fantastic and the service is even better. all the staff was remarkable"
398710392,VCBCX1,"Woking, United Kingdom",2016-07-29,Vancouver X Inn,We arrived jet lagged from the UK and stayed two nights in the XT Metrotown.  Spent the day in the nearby Mall as prices are a lot cheaper than the UK and my teenage daughter needed her shopping fix of the holiday.Good base for our first two nights but this hotel isn't in the tourist area so do not stay here if that is what you are after.  It is close to the Skytrain though so does provide easy access to other parts of the city.I selected this hotel because it has an exec lounge which we like as it means we can leave the kids in the hotel room as they always sleep longer than us in the morning while we go and have a coffee and read the newspaper.Good hotel - clean room and comfortable beds.  Staff were very helpful and we enjoyed our stay.
366518042,VCBCX1,"Wootton,, United Kingdom",2016-04-23,Vancouver X Inn,"Good, medium priced hotel in excellent location a few minutes walk to Skytrain, 10 minutes to downtown Vancouver. Mini suites are excellent value. Breakfast buffet or a la carte. Metrotown shopping centre across the street."
