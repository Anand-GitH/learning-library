# Introduction

In this workshop we go over the steps required to use Java Management Service(JMS) on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure(OCI).

JMS is a reporting and management service within OCI that enables you to use the Oracle Cloud to observe and manage the use of Java in your enterprise.

Estimated Time: 100 minutes

## About Product / Technology

JMS is an OCI native service that helps users observe and manage Java Runtime Environments and applications on-premise or on cloud. JMS can track and report Java usage on-premise (desktops, laptops, and servers), on OCI, and on third-party cloud services. With Javaâ€™s ubiquity and broad usage come significant management challenges. JMS is designed to bring relief in this area and many others.

JMS provides a single pane of glass to manage Java deployments across the enterprise, answering questions such as:
- What are all the Java versions installed on my environment?
- What versions of Java are running in development and production?
- Which JDK distribution is each of these using?
- Are there any unexpected Java applications being used?
- Are all my installed Java versions up to date with the latest security patches?

## Objectives

- Setting Up Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for JMS
- Creating a Fleet and installing management agent on your host
- Deploy Java application and view usage in JMS
- Access and Utilise JMS SDKs
- Track Java Usage in a Container


## Prerequisites:
- An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account with valid credentials
- A host(desktop/laptop/server/virtual machine) with Linux/Windows Operating System
