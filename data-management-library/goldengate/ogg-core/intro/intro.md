### About Oracle GoldenGate
Oracle GoldenGate is a comprehensive software package for real-time data integration and replication.

Enterprise data is distributed across the enterprise in heterogeneous databases. Oracle GoldenGate helps you to load, distribute, and filter transactions within your enterprise in real-time and enables migrations between different databases in near zero-downtime. Oracle GoldenGate enables you to replicate data between Oracle databases to other supported heterogeneous database, and between heterogeneous databases.

You can use Oracle GoldenGate Microservices Architecture to configure and manage your data replication using an HTML user interface.

This diagram illustrates the main components of the Microservices Architecture and how replication processes operate within a secure REST API environment.
