# Connnect to the Database from a UNIX style system

## Introduction

*This lab walks you through the steps required to connect to the database from a UNIX style system

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### About <Product/Technology> (Optional)


### Objectives

*List objectives for this lab using the format below*

In this lab, you will:
* Connect to the database from a UNIX style system

### Prerequisites (Optional)

*List the prerequisites for this lab using the format below. Fill in whatever knowledge, accounts, etc. is needed to complete the lab. Do NOT list each previous lab as a prerequisite.*

* To connect to the database, you'll need the public or private IP address of the DB system.
    - Use the private IP address to connect to the system from your on-premises network, or from within the virtual cloud network (VCN). This includes connecting from a host located on-premises connecting through a VPN or FastConnect to your VCN, or from another host in the same VCN. Use the Exadata system's public IP address to connect to the system from outside the cloud (with no VPN). You can find the IP addresses in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console as follows:
        -  Cloud VM clusters (new resource model): On the Exadata VM Cluster Details page, click Virtual Machines in the Resources list.
        - DB systems: On the DB System Details page, click Nodes in the Resources list.
    - The values are displayed in the Public IP Address and Private IP Address & DNS Name columns of the table displaying the Virtual Machines or Nodes of the Exadata Cloud Service instance.
* For Secure Shell (SSH) access to the DB system, you'll need the full path to the file that contains the private key associated with the public key used when the DB system was launched.


*Below, is the "fold"--where items are collapsed by default.*

## Task 1: Connecting to the database using a UNIX style system

1. Use the following SSH command to access the DB system:
    $ ssh â€“i <private_key> opc@<DB_system_IP_address>

    **<private_key> is the full path and name of the file that contains the private key associated with the DB system you want to access.



## Task 2: Accessing the database after you connect from the terminal

1. Log in as opc and then sudo to the grid user.
    login as: opc

    [opc@ed1db01 ~]$ sudo su - grid

2. List all the databases on the system.
    root@ed1db01 ]# srvctl config database -v

    cdbm01 /u02/app/oracle/product/12.1.0/dbhome_2 12.1.0.2.0
    exadb /u02/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/dbhome_2 11.2.0.4.0
    mmdb /u02/app/oracle/product/12.1.0/dbhome_3 12.1.0.2.0

3. Connect as the oracle user and get the details about one of the databases by using the srvctl command.
    [root@ed1db01 ~]# su - oracle
    [oracle@ed1db01 ~]$ . oraenv
    ORACLE_SID = [oracle] ? cdbm01
    The Oracle base has been set to /u02/app/oracle
    [oracle@ed1db01 ~]$ srvctl config database -d cdbm01
    Database unique name: cdbm01 <<== DB unique name
    Database name:
    Oracle home: /u02/app/oracle/product/12.1.0/dbhome_2
    Oracle user: oracle
    Spfile: +DATAC1/cdbm01/spfilecdbm01.ora
    Password file: +DATAC1/cdbm01/PASSWORD/passwd
    Domain: data.customer1.oraclevcn.com
    Start options: open
    Stop options: immediate
    Database role: PRIMARY
    Management policy: AUTOMATIC
    Server pools:
    Disk Groups: DATAC1,RECOC1
    Mount point paths:
    Services:
    Type: RAC
    Start concurrency:
    Stop concurrency:
    OSDBA group: dba
    OSOPER group: racoper
    Database instances: cdbm011,cdbm012 <<== SID
    Configured nodes: ed1db01,ed1db02
    Database is administrator managed

4. Set the ORACLE_SID and ORACLE_UNIQUE_NAME using the values from the previous step.
    [oracle@ed1db01 ~]$ export ORACLE_UNIQUE_NAME=cdbm01
    [oracle@ed1db01 ~]$ export ORACLE_SID=cdbm011
    [oracle@ed1db01 ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba
