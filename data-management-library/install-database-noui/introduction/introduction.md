# Introduction
 
Oracle Database offers market-leading performance, scalability, reliability, and security, both on-premises and cloud. Oracle Database 19c is the current long term release, and it provides the highest level of release stability and the longest time frame for support and bug fixes. *Long term support* means that Oracle Database 19c comes with 4 years of premium support and a minimum of 3 years of extended support. Oracle Database 19c builds upon the innovations of previous releases such as Multitenant, In-Memory, JSON support, Sharding and many other features that enable Oracle's Autonomous Database Cloud Services.
