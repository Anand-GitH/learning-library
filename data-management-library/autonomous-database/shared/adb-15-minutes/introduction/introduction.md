# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Autonomous Database provides a complete and easy to use platform for database applications. This workshop will provide an introduction to deploying a database optimized for data warehousing workloads, integrating that warehouse with a data lake and then analyzing data across the lakehouse using rich SQL capabilities.

### Oracle MovieStream Business Scenario

* Offer the right products to the right customers at the right price
* Grow the business to become a dominant player in the streaming business and much, much more

### Objectives
