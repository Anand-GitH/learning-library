# Harvest Technical Metadata from Oracle Object Storage

## Introduction

Harvesting is a process that extracts technical metadata from your data assets into your Data Catalog repository. A data asset represents a data source such as database, an object store, a file or document store, a message queue, or an application. This lab walks you through the steps to create an Oracle Object Storage data asset, add a default connection to the new data asset, create a filename pattern and assign it to your data asset, and finally harvest the data asset and view the harvested data entities.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Create an Oracle Object Storage data asset.
* Add three Object Storage connections for the newly created data asset.
* Create a Filename Pattern and assign it to the Oracle Object Storage data asset.
* Harvest the data asset.
* View the harvested data entities.
* Customize the business names for the three Oracle Object Storage buckets.

###Prerequisites  
This lab assumes that you have successfully completed all of the preceding labs in the **Contents** menu.

## Task 1: Log in to the Oracle Cloud Console

1. Log in to the **Oracle Cloud Console** as the Cloud Administrator. You will complete all the labs in this workshop using this Cloud Administrator.

2. On the **Sign In** page, select your tenancy, enter your username and password, and then click **Sign In**. The **Oracle Cloud Console** Home page is displayed.

## Task 2: Create an Object Storage Data Asset

Register your Oracle Object Storage data sources with Data Catalog as a data asset.

1. Open the **Navigation** menu and click **Analytics & AI**. Under **Data Lake**, click **Data Catalog**.

2. On the **Data Catalog Overview** page, click **Go to Data Catalogs**.

   ![](./images/data-catalog-overview.png " ")

3. On the **Data Catalogs** page, click the **`training-dcat-instance`** Data Catalog instance where you want to create your data asset.

   ![](./images/dcat-instance.png " ")

4. On the **`training-dcat-instance`** **Home** page, in the **Quick Actions** tile, click **Create Data Asset**.

   ![](./images/create-data-asset.png " ")

5. In the **Create Data Asset** panel, specify the data asset details as follows:    
       * **Name:** **`Data Lake`**.
       * **Description:** **`Data Asset to access Oracle Object Storage buckets in a different tenancy than yours using public PARs`**.
       * **Type:** Select **Oracle Object Storage** from the drop-down list.
       * **URL:** This is the swift URL for the OCI Object Storage resource that you will use in this lab. The URL field is automatically populated using your own **Home Region**, `us-ashburn-1` in this example. If the Oracle Object Storage buckets that you are harvesting from a different tenancy has a different **Home Region**, then make sure to edit this URL to reflect that home region.

        ```
        https://swiftobjectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com
        ```
        >**Note:** In this lab, you will be accessing three Oracle Object Storage buckets that contain the data using three public pre-authenticated requests (PARs) that are provided for you. The three buckets are located in the **c4u04** tenancy in the **us-ashburn-1** region in our example. In the next step, you'll add three data connections to this data asset using the three pre-authenticated requests (PARs). Note that if you were using an Oracle Object Storage data asset type instead of PAR, you would only need one data connection instead of three. For information on PARs, see [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm) in the _Oracle Cloud Infrastructure_ documentation.

       * **Namespace:** Enter **c4u04**. This is tenancy where the three Oracle Object Storage buckets that you will harvest are located.

6. Click **Create**.

   ![](./images/create-data-asset-panel.png " ")

   A `Data Asset created successfully` message box is displayed. The **Data Lake** tab is displayed. The details for the new data asset are displayed in the **Summary** tab.

   ![](./images/data-lake-tab.png " ")

## Task 3: Gather Information About your Data Catalog Instance and Resources

In later labs, you will need more information about your Data Catalog instance and other resources. You will gather that information now, and save the identified values in your local **`workshop-resources.txt`** text file. This will save you time and steps later.

1. On the **Data Lake** tab that you are currently on from the previous task, copy the value for the **Data asset key** field, and then paste it in the **Data Catalog Data Lake (data asset) Key** section in your local **`workshop-resources.txt`** text file. Save the file.

    ![](./images/paste-user-ocid.png " ")


## Task 4: Add Three Data Asset Connections to the Oracle Object Storage Buckets

After you register a data source as a data asset in your data catalog, you create data connections to your data asset to be able to harvest it. You can create multiple connections to your data source. At least one connection is needed to be able to harvest a data asset. In this lab, you will create three data connections to access the **moviestream\_sandbox**, **moviestream\_landing**, and **moviestream\_gold** Oracle Object Storage buckets that contain the data. The three buckets are located in a different tenancy than yours, **c4u04**; therefore, you will use three provided public pre-authenticated requests (PARs), one for each bucket. For information on PAR, see [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm) in the _Oracle Cloud Infrastructure_ documentation.

Add a connection to the **moviestream_sandbox** bucket to your new **`Data Lake`** data asset as follows:

## Task 5: Create a Filename Pattern and Assign it to your Oracle Object Storage Data Asset

Your data lake typically has a large number of files that represent a single data set. You can group multiple Object Storage files into logical data entities in Data Catalog using filename patterns. A filename pattern is a regular expression that is created to group multiple Object Storage files into a logical data entity that can be used for search and discovery. Using logical data entities, you can organize your data lake content meaningfully and prevent the explosion of your entities and attributes in your Data Catalog.
If an Object Storage file is matched with multiple filename patterns, it can be part of multiple logical data entities.

>**Note:** If you harvest your Object Storage data source files without creating filename patterns, Data Catalog creates an individual logical entity for each file under each root bucket. Imagine this situation with hundreds of files in your data source resulting in hundreds of data entities in your Data Catalog.

Create a filename pattern as follows:

1. On the **Data Lake** tab from the previous task, click the ![](./images/context-menu-icon.png>) tab and select **Filename Patterns** from the **Context** menu.

      ![](./images/click-filename-patterns.png " ")

      The **Filename Patterns** tab is displayed.

      ![](./images/filename-patterns-tab.png " ")

4. Click **Create Filename Pattern**. In the **Create Filename Pattern** panel, specify the following information:

       * **Name:** `folderLE`.
       * **Description:** `Map each Object Storage folder off the moviestream_sandbox, moviestream_landing, and moviestream_gold root buckets to Data Catalog Logical Entities using the selected regular expression`.

       ![](./images/filename-patterns-1.png " ")

5. Click **View Pattern Examples** for examples file pattern styles, sample files, pattern expressions, and the resulting logical data entities that are derived based on the pattern expression. A list of different pattern examples is displayed. Scroll-down the page to the **Non-Hive Style Folders** section, expand it, and then click **Select**.

       ![](./images/filename-patterns-examples.png " ")

       The **Create Filename Pattern** panel is re-displayed. The selected file pattern is displayed in the **Expression** field and the respective test filenames are displayed in the **Test filenames** field.

       ![](./images/test-expression-db.png " ")

       Here's the explanation of the preceding regular expression:      

       * **``{bucketName:[\w]+}``**:      
       This section, between the opening and closing **{ }**, represents the derived bucket name. You can use the **`bucketName`** qualifier to specify that the bucket name should be derived from the path that matches the expression that follows. In this example, the bucket name is comprised of the characters leading up to first **`/`** character (which is outside the name section). `\w` stands for “word character” including alphanumeric characters plus the underscore, ASCII characters [A-Za-z0-9_]. The valid characters are **`A-Z`**, **`a-z`**, **`0-9`**, and **_** (underscore). The **`+`** (plus) indicates any number of occurrences of the preceding expression inside the **[ ]**.

       * **``{logicalEntity:[^/]+}``**:      
       This section, between the second set of opening and closing **{ }**, represents the derived logical entity name. You can use the **`logicalEntity`** qualifier to specify that the logical entity name should be derived from the path that matches the expression that follows. In this example, the logical entity name is comprised of the characters leading up to the second **`/`** character (which is outside the name section). The logical entity name starts after the "/" and ends with the “/” following the closing "}". It can contain any character that is not a forward slash, `/` as represented by the not **`^`** (caret) symbol.  

       * **`/\S+$`**:       
       Finally, the logical data entities names will be any non-whitespace characters (represented by `\S+`). **`$`** signifies the end of the line.

6. Click **Test Expression**. The **Resulting Logical Entities** based on the regular expression that you specified are displayed.

      ![](./images/test-expression.png " ")

      A message box is displayed indicating whether or not the test was successful.    

7. Click **Create**. The **File Patterns** tab is re-displayed. The newly created file pattern is displayed in the **Filename Patterns** list. You might need to click **Refresh** to display the file pattern.

      ![](./images/file-pattern-created.png " ")

8. Assign the filename pattern that you just created to your **Data Lake** data asset. On the **Home** tab, click the **Data Assets** link to access the **Data Assets** tab.

      ![](./images/data-assets-link.png " ")

9. In the **Data Assets** list, click the **Data Lake** data asset for which you want to assign the filename pattern that you created.

      ![](./images/click-data-asset.png " ")

10. In the **Summary** tab on the **Data Lake** details tab, scroll-down the page to the **Filename Patterns** section, and then click **Assign Filename Patterns**.

      ![](./images/click-assign-filename-pattern.png " ")

11. In the **Assign Filename Patterns** panel, select the checkbox next to the filename pattern(s) that you want to assign to this data asset, **folderLE**. You can use the **Filter** box to filter the filename patterns by name. You can also de-select already assigned filename patterns to un-assign them from this data asset.

      ![](./images/assign-filename-pattern-panel.png " ")

12. Click **Assign**. A message box is displayed indicating whether or not the file pattern assignment was successful. The selected filename pattern is assigned to the data asset.

      ![](./images/assignment-successful.png " ")

      When you harvest the data asset, the filename pattern is used to derive logical data entities. The names of the files in the Object Storage bucket are matched to the pattern expression and the logical data entities are formed.

      ![](./images/file-pattern-assigned.png " ")

>**Note:**    
When you assign a new filename pattern to a data asset, the status of any harvested logical data entities is set to **Inactive**. You need to harvest the data asset again to derive the valid logical data entities again.


## Task 6: Harvest the Data Asset

After you create a data asset in the Data Catalog repository, you harvest it to extract the data structure information into the Data Catalog and view its data entities and attributes. In this task, you will harvest the **moviestream\_sandbox**, **moviestream\_landing**, and **moviestream\_gold** Oracle Object Storage buckets that contain the data.

## Task 8: Customize the Business Name for the Object Storage Buckets

Customize the business names for each of the three Oracle Object Storage buckets that you use in this workshop.
When you later perform the synchronization process between your ADB and Data Catalog instances, the schemas and tables are created automatically for you. By default, the names of the schemas will start with **`DCAT$`** concatenated with the data asset's name, **`Data Lake`**, and the folder's (bucket's) name such as **`moviestream_sandbox`**. All three bucket names start with **`moviestream_`** followed by **`sandbox`**, **`landing`**, or **`gold`**. To make the generated schema names a bit shorter, you will customize the business name for each bucket and remove the **`moviestream_`** prefix from their names. For example, the generated schema name for the **`moviestream_sandbox`** will be **`DCAT$DATA_LAKE_SANDBOX`** instead of **`DCAT$DATA_LAKE_MOVIESTREAM_SANDBOX`**.
>**Note:** Later in this workshop, you will also provide a shorter custom property override that will be used in the schemas names instead of the data asset name.

1. On the **Data Catalogs** page, click the **`training-dcat-instance`** Data Catalog instance link.
