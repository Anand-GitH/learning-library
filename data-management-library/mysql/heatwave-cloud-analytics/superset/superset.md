# Create compartment

## Introduction
Before you start to provision any OCI resources, it is a good practice to create a **compartment** as an isolated environment for your work. 
In this lab, we will create a compartment for all the OCI resources required to host our PHP application as well as MySQL HeatWave cluster

Estimated Time: 2 minutes

## Task 1: Create Compartment

1. Log in to **OCI** and click on the <a href="#menu">&#9776; hamburger menu</a> at the top left corner of the OCI console, and type **compartment** in the search box. Click on the **Compartments** in the search result
