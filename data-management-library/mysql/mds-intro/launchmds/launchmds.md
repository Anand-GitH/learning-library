5. Indicate the location of the private key you created earlier with **MDS_Client**. 
    
6. Enter the username **opc** and the Public **IP Address**.

- Note: The **MDS_Client**  shows the  Public IP Address as mentioned on TASK 5: #10
    
- (Example: **ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@&132.145.170.990**)

    `$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@&<your_compute_instance_ip>;`

    ![Connect](./images/06connect01.png " ")

    ![Connect](./images/06connect03.png " ")

9. Install MySQL Shell with the following command 

    `[opc@...]$ sudo yum install –y mysql-shell`
    ![Connect](./images/06connect05.png " ")
 
10. From your Compute instance, connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool. 
    
   - The endpoint (IP Address) can be found in the MySQL Database System Details page, under the "Endpoints" resource. 

    ![Connect](./images/06connect06.png " ")

11.  Use the following command to connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool.

    (Example  **mysqlsh -uadmin -p -h132.145.170.990**)
    
    `[opc@...]$ mysqlsh -u<MDS_admin_username> -p -h<MDS_endpoint>`

    ![Connect](./images/06connect07.png " ")

12. On MySQL Shell, switch to SQL mode  to try out some SQL commands 

13. Type the following command at the prompt:
    
    `\SQL`

    ![Connect](./images/06connect13.png " ")

14. To display a list of databases, type the following command at the prompt:
   
    `SHOW DATABASES;`
    
15. To display the database version, current_date, and user type the following command at the prompt:

    `SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE, USER();`

16. To display MysQL user and host from user table type the following command at the prompt:
    
    `SELECT USER, HOST FROM mysql.user;`

17. (Optional) At this point, you can also use MySQL Workbench from your local machine to connect to the MySQL endpoint using your new Compute instance as a jump box. 

18. In your pre installed MySQL Workbench, configure a connection using the method "Standard TCP/IP over SSH" and use the credentials of the Compute instance for SSH. 
   
19. MySQL Workbench Configuration for MDS:

5. Select one of the following actions:
- Start: Starts a stopped Database System. After the Database System is started, the Stop action is enabled and the Start option is disabled.
- Stop: Stops a running Database System. After the Database System is powered off, the Start action is enabled.
- Restart: Shuts down a Database System, and restarts it.
- Note: Stopping a Database System stops billing for all OCPUs associated with it. 
- Billing continues for storage. 
- Billing for OCPUs resumes if you restart the Database System.
- If you selected Stop or Restart, the Stop/Restart MySQL Database System dialog is displayed.

6. Select a shutdown type:
- Fast: Flushes dirty pages before shutting down the Database System. 
- Some flush operations must be performed during next startup, potentially increasing the duration of the startup process.
- Slow: Flushes dirty pages and purges undo log pages for older transactions. 
-  The shutdown itself can take longer, but the subsequent startup is faster.
- Immediate: Does not flush dirty pages and does not purge any undo log pages. 
- Stops MySQL immediately. Page flushes and log purging will take place during the next startup, increasing the duration of the startup process.

7. Select the required shutdown type and click the Stop or Restart button, depending on the action chosen.

## **TASK 8:** Delete MySQL Database System

Deleting a Database System permanently deletes it. Any manual backups associated with the deleted Database System are retained for their retention periods. Automatic backups are deleted with the Database System.

1. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Databases**, and select **Database Systems**.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/database-dbsys.png " ")
