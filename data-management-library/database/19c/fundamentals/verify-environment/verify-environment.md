# Verify Your Environment

## Introduction

During the workshop, you use two Linux compute instances named `workshop-staged` and `workshop-installed`. Both compute instances have a noVNC desktop, which provides an easy-to-use interface. You are automatically signed in to these compute instances as the `oracle` user (password is `Ora4U_1234`).

- The `workshop-staged` compute instance has the Oracle Database 19c installer files (release 19.12) staged on it. Only the **Install Oracle Database 19c with Automatic Root Script Execution** lab uses this compute instance. The rest of the labs use the `workshop-installed` compute instance.
- The `workshop-installed` compute instance has Oracle Database 19c (release 19.12) already installed on it with two CDBs (CDB1 and CDB2). CDB1 has one pluggable database named PDB1 with sample data. CDB2 has no PDBs. CDB1, PDB1, and CDB2 are configured to use the default listener, which is called LISTENER. The listener and the database instances are configured to automatically start up on boot. The lab files are stored in the `/home/oracle/labs/19cnf` directory.

In this lab, you verify that your `workshop-installed` compute instance is properly started.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Verify that the default listener (LISTENER) is started on the `workshop-installed` compute instance
- Verify that you can connect to CDB1, PDB1, and CDB2 on the `workshop-installed` compute instance

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you have:

- Obtained and signed in to your `workshop-installed` compute instance


## Task 1: Verify that the default listener (LISTENER) is started on the `workshop-installed` compute instance

1. On the desktop of your `workshop-installed` compute instance, open a terminal window. Notice that you are signed in to the Linux operating system as the `oracle` user.

2. Use the Listener Control Utility to verify that the default listener is started. Look for `status READY` for CDB1, PDB1, and CDB2 in the Services Summary.

    ```

3. If the default listener is not started, run the following command to start it.

    ```
    LSNRCTL> <copy>lsnrctl start</copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Verify that you can connect to CDB1, PDB1, and CDB2 on the `workshop-installed` compute instance

1. Set the Oracle environment variables. At the prompt, enter **CDB1**.

    ```
    $ <copy>. oraenv</copy>
    CDB1
    ```

2. Using SQL*Plus, connect to CDB1 as the `SYS` user.

    ```
    $ <copy>sqlplus / as sysdba</copy>
    ```

3. Connect to PDB1.

    ```
    SQL> <copy>alter session set container = PDB1;</copy>

    Session altered.
    ```

4. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    SQL> <copy>exit</copy>
    ```

5. Set the Oracle environment variables. At the prompt, enter **CDB2**.

    ```
    $ <copy>. oraenv</copy>
    CDB2
    ```

6. Using SQL*Plus, connect to CDB1.

    ```
    $ <copy>sqlplus / as sysdba</copy>
    ```

7. Exit SQL*Plus.

    ```
    SQL> <copy>exit</copy>
    ```

8. Close the terminal window.

    ```
    $ <copy>exit</copy>
    ```


## Appendix A: Restore your lab files

In the event that you accidentally change one or more of your lab files on your `workshop-installed` compute instance and need to restore them, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Change to the `~/labs/19cnf` directory.

    ```
    $ <copy>cd ~/labs/19cnf</copy>
    ```

3. Unzip the `19cnf-lab-files.zip` file and replace the files in the directory.

    ```
    $ <copy>unzip -o 19cnf-lab-files.zip</copy>
    ```

4. Set the execute permission on all of the lab files.

    ```
    $ <copy>chmod -R +x ~/labs/19cnf</copy>
    ```
