# Interval Partitioning 

## Introduction
Interval partitioning is an extension to range partitioning in which database table partition is done based on intervals rather than just date itself. The INTERVAL clause of the CREATE TABLE statement establishes interval partitioning for the table. You must specify at least one range partition using the PARTITION clause. The range partitioning key value determines the high value of the range partitions, called the transition point. The database automatically creates interval partitions for data beyond that transition point. The lower boundary of every interval partition is the non-inclusive upper boundary of the previous range or interval partition.

 This Lab will teach you how to create Interval Partitioning.

### Features

*	Introduced with Oracle 11g
*	Extension to Range Partitioning
*	Full Automation for equal-sized range partitions
*	Part of Composite Level Partitioning 
*	Difference Interval and Range Partitioning
*	Naming Template only for Range
*	System generated names for interval 
*	No need for any Partition management

### Analysing Business Data at various intervals 

In Financial Services or Retail Industry, when Business Analysts want to view sales data based on daily, monthly, quarterly or yearly, it is easier to partition data based on intervals. As the data keeps growing, the partitions keep getting created automatically.  
 
### Objectives
 
In this lab, you will:
* Create Interval Partitions

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have completed the following lab:

- Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database and ADW Instance has been created
  
## Task 1: Create Interval Partitions

Let's Create Interval Partitions Table. The following example specifies two partitions with varying interval widths of one month.
 
```
<copy>
create table  
interval_par_demo (  
   start_date        DATE, 
   store_id          NUMBER, 
   inventory_id      NUMBER(6), 
   qty_sold          NUMBER(3) 
)  
PARTITION BY RANGE (start_date)  
INTERVAL(NUMTOYMINTERVAL(1, 'MONTH'))  
(   
   PARTITION interval_par_demo_p2 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('1-7-2007', 'DD-MM-YYYY')), 
   PARTITION interval_par_demo_p3 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('1-8-2007', 'DD-MM-YYYY'))  
);
</copy>
```

## Task 2: Auto Generate Interval Partitions


insert records
```
<copy>
insert into interval_par_demo (start_date, store_id, inventory_id, qty_sold)  
values ( '15-AUG-07', 1, 1, 1); 
insert into interval_par_demo (start_date, store_id, inventory_id, qty_sold)  
values ( '15-SEP-07', 1, 1, 1);
</copy>
```  

```
<copy>
SELECT  
   TABLE_NAME,  
   PARTITION_NAME,  
   PARTITION_POSITION,  
   HIGH_VALUE 
FROM  
   USER_TAB_PARTITIONS  
WHERE  
   TABLE_NAME='INTERVAL_PAR_DEMO' 
ORDER BY  
   PARTITION_NAME;
</copy>
```

Data in  interval\_par\_demo  table

Data in  USER\_TAB\_PARTITIONS

SYS_P1708 and SYS_P1709 are autogenerated partitions based on intervals. Verify data in newly created partitions, and Please Note that the auto Generated partition name might vary in your instance.

```
<copy> 
SELECT * FROM interval_par_demo PARTITION(SYS_P1708);
</copy>
```
![Image alt text](images/lab2_05.png "SYS_P1708 Data")

```
<copy> 
SELECT * FROM interval_par_demo PARTITION(SYS_P1709);
</copy>
```
![Image alt text](images/lab2_06.png "SYS_P1709 Data")

## Task 3: Cleanup
 

```
<copy>
rem cleanup of all objects
drop table interval_par_demo purge; 
</copy>
```
   
You successfully made it to the end this lab Interval Partitions.
