# Deploy and Test Kafka Broker and Kafka Producer and Consumer Microservices

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to deploy a Kafka Cluster, a Producer, and a Consumer microservices into your docker engine, walk through the functionality and explain how it works. Both microservices are adopting Spring Boot and Spring Kafka frameworks.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

- Deploy and access the Kafka Cluster
- Deploy and access the Kafka Producer Microservice
- Deploy and access the Kafka Consumer Microservice
- Learn how they work

### Prerequisites

- *[Optional]* An Oracle Cloud paid account or free trial. To sign up for a trial account with $300 in credits for 30 days, click [Sign Up](http://oracle.com/cloud/free).
- A Docker Engine accessible.

## **Task** 1: Run Kafka Broker and Create a Topic

1. Execute the following sequence of commands to start the Kafka cluster and connect Broker to Lab8022 Network:

 ```bash
 <copy>
 cd $LAB_HOME/cloud-setup/confluent-kafka
 ./docker-compose up -d
 docker network connect lab8022network broker
 </copy>
 ```

2. Once successfully executed, check that the services are running:

 ```bash
 <copy>
 cd $LAB_HOME/cloud-setup/confluent-kafka
 ./docker-compose ps
 </copy>
 ```

 First, you will see the four containers running, but the container from Connect Service will be *starting*

 After a few seconds, the container from Connect Service will be *healthy*

3. Create a Topic:

 You are ready to create the topic *LAB8022_TOPIC*. Run the following command to create a new topic into the Kafka Broker:

 ```bash
 <copy>
 docker exec broker \
  kafka-topics --bootstrap-server broker:9092 \
  --create \
  --topic LAB8022_TOPIC
 </copy>
 ```

 After a WARNING message that you can disregard, you will see the message **"Created topic LAB8022_TOPIC."**

## **Task** 2: Verify configurations and build applications

The Kafka Producer and Consumer adopt Spring Boot and Spring Kafka frameworks. The Producer exposes a REST service that will produce a message and publish it in the Kafka Broker created. And on the other side, the Consumer will subscribe to the same topic and consume messagesâ€”a straightforward and typical case but instructive and essential when compared with the next lab.

1. Confirm that Kafka Producer and Consumer Configurations are pointing to the correct Broker Address and Topic.

 As you can verify in the above image, Kafka Broker runs at address Broker:9092. We have to confirm that this address is right inside the application.yml from the Producer App. A tip, internally to Docker, Kafka broker is advertised for other nodes on port 29092.

 ```bash
  <copy>cat $LAB_HOME/springboot-kafka/kafka-producer/src/main/resources/application.yaml</copy>
 ```

 Repeat for Kafka Consumer

 ```bash
  <copy>cat $LAB_HOME/springboot-kafka/kafka-consumer/src/main/resources/application.yaml</copy>
 ```

 The proper configuration will be for both:

- bootstrap-servers: broker:29092
- topic-name: LAB8022_TOPIC

 ![Spring Boot Producer App Configuration](images/springboot-kafka-config.png " ")

 Attention: If you change these configurations, you will have to modify these parameters.

2. Build the Applications

 We use Maven to build the applications Producer and Consumer and the configuration module. Run this command to build them:

 ```bash
  <copy>
  cd $LAB_HOME/springboot-kafka
  mvn clean install -DskipTests
  </copy>
 ```

 As a result, all modules were built with success.

## **Task** 3: Deploy and Test Spring Boot Kafka Producer

1. Deploy Kafka Producer Microservice

 Now that we have the applications successfully built, we can deploy them and test them. Let's start with the Producer. Run these commands to build the image and deploy the Producer inside the Docker Engine (the same running the Kafka Cluster):

 ```bash
  <copy>
  cd $LAB_HOME/springboot-kafka/kafka-producer
  ./build.sh
  </copy>
 ```

 Now, let's run the Producer:

 ```bash
  <copy>
  docker run --detach --name=kafka-producer --network lab8022network -p 8080:8080 oracle-developers-kafka-producer:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
  </copy>
 ```

 We can check the logs and see the Producer running and waiting for requests:

 ```bash
  <copy>
  docker logs kafka-producer
  </copy>
 ```

2. Test Kafka Producer Microservice

 We will use the cURL command to test our Producer.

 ```bash
  <copy>
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "id": "id1", "message": "message1" } ' \
  http://localhost:8080/placeMessage
  </copy>
 ```

 The result should be

 ```bash
  {"id":"0","statusMessage":"Successful"}%
 ```

 We also can validate if the message was published inside topic LAB8022_TOPIC.

 ```bash
  <copy>
  docker exec --interactive --tty broker \
  kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server broker:9092 \
  --topic LAB8022_TOPIC \
  --from-beginning
  </copy>
 ```

 The result will be similar to :

 You will need to press Crtl+C to stop this process.

## **Task** 4: Deploy and Test Spring Boot Kafka Consumer

Now that we have Producer running and publishing events inside the Kafka Broker, you will do the same with Consumer.

1. Deploy Kafka Consumer Microservice

 We will follow the same steps to deploy and test the Kafka Consumer microservice. Run these commands to build the image and deploy the Consumer inside the Docker Engine (the same running the Kafka Cluster):

 ```bash
  <copy>
  cd $LAB_HOME/springboot-kafka/kafka-consumer
  ./build.sh
  </copy>
 ```

 Now, let's run the Consumer :

 ```bash
  <copy>
  docker run --detach --name=kafka-consumer --network lab8022network oracle-developers-kafka-consumer:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
  </copy>
 ```

 We can check the logs and see the Consumer running:

 ```bash
  <copy>
  docker logs kafka-consumer
  </copy>
 ```

 ![Spring Boot Kafka Consumer Running Logs](images/springboot-kafka-consumer-running.png " ")

 And finally, We can now produce and consume messages from Kafka Broker; the result inside logs of Consumer will be:

 ![Spring Boot Kafka Consumer Running Logs](images/springboot-kafka-consumer-test.png " ")

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
